- It was a paramilitary Lord of the Flies,
- Bullying was considered a virtue,
- It was so insane, mind-blowing,
- Don’t be stupid like that dumb fuck who died last year,
- Don’t be the weak dumb fuck.
- I realized by then that if someone bullied me, I could punch them very hard in the nose, and then they wouldn’t bully me again. They might beat the shit out of me, but if I had punched them hard in the nose, they wouldn’t come after me again.
- You’re not going to kill him, are you?
- Then they damn well shot the dog dead.
- If you have never been punched in the nose, you have no idea how it affects you the rest of your life,
- They sat on him and just kept beating the shit out of him and kicking him in the head,
- When they got finished, I couldn’t even recognize his face. It was such a swollen ball of flesh that you could barely see his eyes.
- The boy had just lost his father to suicide, and Elon had called him stupid,
- Elon had this tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?
- I had to stand for an hour as he yelled at me and called me an idiot and told me that I was just worthless,
- My father just lost it, went ballistic, as he often did. He had zero compassion.
- It was mental torture,
- He sure knew how to make anything terrible.
- Their experiences with me would have made veldskool quite tame,
- Two held you down while another pummeled your face with a log and so on. New boys were forced to fight the school thug on their first day at a new school.
- an extremely stern streetwise autocracy
- Elon would later apply that same stern autocracy to himself and others.
- Adversity shaped me
- Someone once said that every man is trying to live up to his father’s expectations or make up for his father’s mistakes,
- and I suppose that may explain my particular malady.
- demon mode.
- he might become his father.
- With a childhood like his in South Africa, I think you have to shut yourself down emotionally in some ways,
- If your father is always calling you a moron and idiot, maybe the only response is to turn off anything inside that would’ve opened up an emotional dimension that he didn’t have tools to deal with.
- He learned to shut down fear,
- If you turn off fear, then maybe you have to turn off other things, like joy or empathy.
- I just don’t think he knows how to savor success and smell the flowers,
- I think he got conditioned in childhood that life is pain.
- Adversity shaped me,
- My pain threshold became very high.
- I’d heard him use those phrases himself,
- It had a profound effect on how he operates.
- I think he wasn’t conscious of how that still affected him, because he thought of it as something in his childhood,
- But he’s retained a childlike, almost stunted side. Inside the man, he’s still there as a child, a child standing in front of his dad.
- Elon wants risk for its own sake,
- He seems to enjoy it, indeed at times be addicted to it.
- I was born for a storm, and a calm does not suit me,
- He is a drama magnet,
- That’s his compulsion, the theme of his life.
- But if I had run Apple, we may never have made the Macintosh.
- I need to shift my mindset away from being in crisis mode,
- which it has been in for about fourteen years now, or arguably most of my life.
- I made an offer,
- perversion of cultural ideals
- a disproportionate number of Jews occupy positions of control.
- I don’t date my clients.
- When will you marry me?
- Tomorrow.
- perhaps the most remarkable figure in the history of flying chiropractors,
- the flying twins.
- This is where we’ll stay.
- the Great Farini,
- lost city
- This fabulist showed my grandfather pictures that were obviously fake, but he became a believer and decided it was his mission to rediscover it,
- Live dangerously—carefully.
- They had to remove the back seats to put in gas tanks,
- He knew that real adventures involve risk,
- Risk energized him.
- I know that I can take a risk as long as I’m prepared,
- She was the strongest person I ever met,
- Reaction against the Establishment.
- If you registered it, you would wind up with nothing, because the Blacks would take everything from you,
- I don’t have anything against the Blacks, but they are just different from what I am,
- Many people came to me with stolen parcels,
- On trips overseas I would sell emeralds to jewelers. It was a cloak-and-dagger thing, because none of it was legal.
- Because of grief, I dropped ten pounds,
- It was clear that marrying him had been a mistake,
- but now it was impossible to undo.
- the Elon.
- I can’t do that,
- He needs someone besides me to talk to. I really have this genius child.
- The teacher would come up to me and yell at me, but I would not really see or hear her,
- We have reason to believe that Elon is retarded.
- He looks out of the window all the time, and when I tell him to pay attention he says, ‘The leaves are turning brown now.’ 
- They decided it was an ear problem, so they took my adenoids out,
- Ever since I was a kid, if I start to think about something hard, then all of my sensory systems turn off,
- I can’t see or hear or anything. I’m using my brain to compute, not for incoming information.
- It’s best not to try to break through when he has that vacant stare,
- stupid
- Once he started going to school, he became so lonely and sad,
- Kimbal and Tosca would make friends on the first day and bring them home, but Elon never brought friends home. He wanted to have friends, but he just didn’t know how.
- When I was a child, there’s one thing I said,
-  ‘I never want to be alone.’ That’s what I would say. ‘I don’t want to be alone.’ 
- I kind of knew what the route looked like because I had seen it from a car, and I was determined to get there, so I just started walking,
- He has this fierce determination that blows your mind and was sometimes frightening, and still is.
- It just was extraordinary to watch,
- He would stand there silently, then resume his argument, then stand silent.
- Some kid found me crying and took me to his mom, who gave me milk and biscuits and called the police,
- It was insane to leave me and my brother alone in a park at that age,
- but my parents weren’t overprotective like parents are today.
- He was never actually diagnosed as a kid,
- but he says he has Asperger’s, and I’m sure he’s right.
- I took people literally when they said something,
- and it was only by reading books that I began to learn that people did not always say what they really meant.
- Over time, he had gotten crazier,
- He would hit me when the kids were around. I remember that Elon, who was five, would hit him on the backs of his knees to try to stop him.
- absolute rubbish.
- I’ve never laid a hand on a woman in my life, and certainly none of my wives,
- That’s one of women’s weapons is to cry that the man abused her, to cry and to lie. And a man’s weapons are to buy and to sign.
- Don’t you dare touch her again,
- If you do, she’s coming to live with me.
- boring, stupid, and ugly.
- I had a very pretty wife, but there were always prettier, younger girls,
- I really loved Maye, but I screwed up.
- He would send them back without any clothes or bags, so I had to buy them new clothes every time,
- He said that I would eventually return to him, because I would be so poverty-stricken and wouldn’t be able to feed them.
- I never felt guilty about working full-time, because I didn’t have a choice,
- My children had to be responsible for themselves.
- You’ll figure it out.
- Mom wasn’t soft and cuddly, and she was always working, but that was a gift for us.
- I remember Mom just sitting there, sobbing on the couch. I didn’t know what to do. All I could do was to hold her.
- She had been a friend of mine,
- We had modeled together.
- beaming with delight, like the sun,
- Hi Dad, let’s get a hamburger!
- My dad was lonely, so lonely, and I felt I should keep him company,
- He used psychological wiles on me.
- It turned out to be a really bad idea,
- I didn’t yet know how horrible he was.
- I didn’t want to leave my brother alone with him,
- My dad guilted my brother into going to live with him. And then he guilted me.
- Why did he choose to go live with someone who inflicted pain?
- Why didn’t he prefer a happy home?
- Maybe that’s just who he is.
- It was by far the most exciting thing,
- We didn’t have that yet in South Africa.
- When we got to Orlando, my father refused to take us to Disney World because it was too expensive,
- I think we went to some water park instead.
- I told them over and over on the trip, ‘America is where you will come live someday.’ 
- My father had some combination of legitimate business and hucksterism,
- He left us in the hotel, which was pretty grungy, and just gave us fifty bucks or something, and we didn’t see him for two days.
- Nowadays someone would call the child-protection service if someone did what our dad did,
- but for us back then it was a wondrous experience.
- If we wanted to do something like go to a concert in Johannesburg, she would say to her sister, I’m going to go take them to church camp this evening,
- Then she would drop us off and we would go do our mischief.
- I remember once when the train stopped, there was an immense fight, and we watched a guy get stabbed through the head,
- We were hiding inside the car, then the doors closed, and we were like moving on.
- We didn’t try to hide from the violence, we became survivors of it,
- It taught us to not be afraid but also to not do crazy things.
- It’s a big theme for him to never have his decisions guided by fear,
- That was definitely present even when he was a child.
- They were wrestling and punching each other in the dust,
- People were freaking out, and I had to say to the crowd, ‘This is not a big deal. These guys are brothers.’ 
- The way to win was to be the first person to punch or kick the other guy in the balls,
- That would end the fight because you can’t continue if you get crunched in the balls.
- He is quick to grasp new mathematical concepts,
- He works extremely slowly, either because he dreams or is doing what he should not.
- He seldom finishes anything. Next year he must concentrate on his work and not daydream during class.
- His compositions show a lively imagination, but he doesn’t always finish in time.
- not extending himself,
- I wasn’t really going to put a lot of effort into things I thought were meaningless,
- I would rather be reading or playing video games.
- Some people would balk at the price,
- but we told them, ‘You’re actually supporting future capitalists.’ 
- They’re always trying to save the world, with their underpants on the outside or these skin-tight iron suits, which is really pretty strange when you think about it,
- But they are trying to save the world.
- genius boy.
- Look at the moon, it must be a million miles away,
- No, it’s like 239,000 miles, depending on the orbit.
- I would come back from school and go to a side room in my father’s office and read it over and over,
- That book is what first made me think about going to other planets,
- What do you mean, the waters parted?
- That’s not possible.
- I took the blood and body of Christ, which is weird when you’re a kid,
- I said, ‘What the hell is this? Is this a weird metaphor for cannibalism?’ 
- There are no atheist pilots,
- There are no atheists at exam time.
- I began trying to figure out what the meaning of life and the universe was,
- And I got real depressed about it, like maybe life may have no meaning.
- I do not recommend reading Nietzsche as a teenager,
- A robot may not harm humanity, or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.
- Foundation Series & Zeroth Law are fundamental to creation of SpaceX.
- The Hitchhiker’s Guide,
- helped me out of my existential depression, and I soon realized it was amazingly funny in all sorts of subtle ways.
- had turned unfathomability into an art form.
- Answer to The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.
- That quite definitely is the answer. I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you’ve never actually known what the question is.
- I took from the book that we need to extend the scope of consciousness so that we are better able to ask the questions about the answer, which is the universe,
- There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened.
- Even as a kid, Elon had a whole bunch of different demeanors and moods,
- As a Dungeon Master, he was incredibly patient, which is not, in my experience, always his default personality, if you know what I mean. It happens sometimes, and it’s so beautiful when it does.
- I think you’re the bad guy.
- These guys were idiots,
- It was so obvious.
- I had read computer magazines,
- but I had never actually seen a computer before.
- I did it in three days, barely sleeping,
- essential
- This boy must get a new computer,
- In this game, you have to destroy an alien space freighter, which is carrying deadly Hydrogen Bombs and Status Beam Machines.
- If you’re playing with Elon, you play pretty much nonstop until finally you have to eat,
- We knew exactly which games were the most popular, so it seemed like a sure thing,
- He was just too hard of a human,
- So we went to Russ and Pete’s dad, and he flipped out. That basically shut the whole thing down.
- His mood could change on a dime,
- Everything could be super, then within a second he would be vicious and spewing abuse.
- One minute he would be super friendly,
- and the next he would be screaming at you, lecturing you for hours—literally two or three hours while he forced you to just stand there—calling you worthless, pathetic, making scarring and evil comments, not allowing you to leave.
- You never knew what you were in for,
- Sometimes Errol would be like, ‘I just got us some new motorbikes so let’s jump on them.’ At other times he would be angry and threatening and, oh fuck, make you clean the toilets with a toothbrush.
- When Elon’s in a good mood, it’s like the coolest, funnest thing in the world. And when he’s in a bad mood, he goes really dark, and you’re just walking on eggshells.
- It was nuts,
- almost total solution to what is called randomness.
- There are no ‘random events’ or ‘chance.’ All events follow the Fibonacci Sequence, like the Mandelbrot Set. I went on to discover the relationship between ‘chance’ and the Fibonacci Sequence. This is the subject for a scientific paper. If I share it, all activities relying on ‘chance’ will be ruined, so I am in doubt as to doing that.
- I don’t know how he went from being great at engineering to believing in witchcraft. But he somehow made that evolution.
- He changes reality around him,
- He will literally make up things, but he actually believes his own false reality.
- Can you imagine growing up like that?
- It was mental torture, and it infects you. You end up asking, ‘What is reality?’ 
- Elon and Kimbal have developed their own narrative about what I was like, and it doesn’t accord with the facts,
- I don’t care if they choose a different narrative, as long as they are happy. I have no desire for it to be my word versus theirs. Let them have the floor.
- I would see shades of these horrible stories Elon told me surface in his own behavior,
- It made me realize how difficult it is not to be shaped by what we grew up with, even when that’s not what we want.
- You’re turning into your father.
- It was our code phrase to warn him that he was going into the realm of darkness.
- With Errol, there was a sense that really bad things could happen around him. Whereas if the zombie apocalypse happened, you’d want to be on Elon’s team, because he would figure out a way to get those zombies in line. He can be very harsh, but at the end of the day, you can trust him to find a way to prevail.
- So then I was like, ‘Well, I’m just going to go by myself,’ 
- I would have left the next morning, but airline tickets were cheaper back then if you bought them fourteen days in advance,
- so I had to wait those two weeks.
- You’ll be back in a few months,
- You’ll never be successful.
- Do you want to go and study in America?
- Yes,
- It was my idea. Up until then, he had never said that he wanted to go to America. So I said, ‘Well, tomorrow you should go and see the American cultural attaché,’ who was a friend of mine from Rotary.
- I was used to South Africa, where people will just rob and kill you,
- So I slept on my backpack until I realized that not everyone was a murderer.
- Hey, it’s Elon, your cousin from South Africa,
- I’m at the bus station.
- Happy Birthday Elon
- If the person at the end of the tunnel didn’t remove the goo fast enough, you would be trapped while sweating your guts out,
- It was like a Dickensian steampunk nightmare filled with dark pipes and the sound of jackhammers.
- I worked every day and also four nights a week,
- I took off one afternoon, Sunday, to do the laundry and get groceries. I didn’t even know what my kids were doing, because I was hardly at home.
- I’m coming with you,
- No you’re not,
- You have to stay ten feet away from me at all times.
- Waterloo was definitely better for engineering, but it didn’t seem great from a social standpoint,
- There were few girls there.
- I didn’t want to spend my undergraduate time with a bunch of dudes.
- international floor
- For me and Elon,
- it was probably the first place we were socially accepted and could be ourselves.
- how to work collaboratively with smart people and make use of the Socratic method to achieve commonality of purpose,
- I was really hungry for that,
- because until then I had no friends I could talk to about these things.
- What you’re doing is not rational,
- You’re actually hurting yourself.
- If you do this, I will turn your allies against you and inflict pain on you.
- We completely entered a zone for hours until we were exhausted,
- I am wired for war,
- If we were able to get through on the phone, they usually would have lunch with us,
- I was interested in the philosophical side of physics and how it related to reality,
- I didn’t have a lot of other people to talk to about these things.
- Do you ever think about electric cars?
- Brady Bonds.
- Yeah, how much you want?
- Would it be possible to get five million?
- I was like, ‘Jackpot, no-lose proposition here,’ 
- I ran to tell Peter about it and thought they would give me some money to do it.
- Wow, this is just insane,
- Is this how banks think?
- He came away with an impression that the bank was a lot dumber than in fact it was,
- But that was a good thing, because it gave him a healthy disrespect for the financial industry and the audacity to eventually start what became PayPal.
- I was concerned that if I didn’t study business, I would be forced to work for someone who did,
- My goal was to engineer products by having a feel for the physics and never have to work for a boss with a business degree.
- If this position ever appears on my résumé, to stand on [my] head and eat 50 copies of the offending document in a public place.
- He was the only person better than me at physics,
- He kept talking about making a rocket that could go to Mars,
- Of course, I didn’t pay much attention, because I thought he was fantasizing.
- I want to go make that happen,
- The Importance of Being Solar.
- Society will soon have no option but to focus on renewable power sources,
- power station of the future,
- very interesting and well written paper, except the last figure that comes out of the blue.
- Life, the Universe, and Everything.
- Revolution
- I filled eight garbage bags and swept the place, and I thought they would be grateful,
- But they didn’t even notice.
- The house was shaking and bouncing so much from the music that I thought a ceiling might collapse, so I figured if I was at the edge I’d be safer.
- I was stone cold sober at the time,
- Adeo would get wasted. I’d be banging on his door and say, like, ‘Dude, you’ve got to come up and manage the party.’ I ended up being the one who had to keep an eye on things.
- He enjoyed being around a party but not fully in it. The only thing he binged on was video games.
- I wish Elon knew how to be a little happier,
- supercapacitor
- It is important to note that the Ultracapacitor is not simply an incremental improvement, but a radically new technology.
- None of the senior engineers had been able to solve this problem, and I solved it in two weeks,
- I wanted to have more impact,
- It was really able to haul ass,
- We both were, like, university sucks, there’s no hurry to get back,
- so we did a three-week road trip.
- His mom had a number of these necklaces in a case in her bedroom, and Elon told me they were from his father’s emerald mine in South Africa—he pulled one from the case,
- He was fascinated by how they designed the robotic machines to handle the luggage without human intervention,
- It was over-automated, and they underestimated the complexity of what they were building,
- The idea was to leverage advanced chip-making equipment to make a solid state ultracapacitor with enough energy density to give a car long range,
- I figured I could spend several years at Stanford, get a PhD, and my conclusion on capacitors would be that they aren’t feasible,
- Most PhDs are irrelevant. The number that actually move the needle is almost none.
- I thought about the things that will truly affect humanity,
- I came up with three: the internet, sustainable energy, and space travel.
- Big Yellow,
- Why don’t we do it ourselves?
- The internet revolution only comes once in a lifetime, so strike while the iron is hot,
- You will have lots of time to go to graduate school later if you’re still interested.
- I need to put everything else on hold,
- I need to catch the internet wave.
- I’ve written some software with the first internet maps and Yellow Pages directory,
- I will probably fail, and if so I would like to come back.
- Do you honestly think you’re ever going to replace this?
- I can still tell you every single menu item,
- It’s just seared into my brain.
- All it had was two mattresses and lots of Cocoa Puffs boxes,
- He had no pillow, he had no sleeping bag. I don’t know how he did it,
- Once in a while, if we had a customer meeting in the morning, I’d have to tell him to go home and shower.
- If you want your friendship to last,
- this is not for you.
- I knew that I could either be working with him or be his friend, but not both, and the latter seemed more enjoyable.
- You could use your cursor and zoom in and move around the map,
- That stuff is totally normal today, but it was mind-blowing to see that at the time. I think Elon and I were the first humans to see it work on the internet.
- Zip to where you want to go.
- interactive network directory service
- The invention provides a network accessible service which integrates both a business directory and a map database,
- The Machine That Goes Ping,
- Every time investors would come in, we showed them the tower,
- and we would laugh because it made them think we were doing hardcore stuff.
- It was a dollar a page for color, which we could barely afford,
- We would all be exhausted except Elon. He was always up late doing the coding.
- That’s the last time we’ll have to use my credit card,
- We love our mom,
- It was the most beautiful car you could imagine,
- but it broke down at least once a week.
- I never wanted to be a CEO,
- but I learned that you could not truly be the chief technology or product officer unless you were the CEO.
- Newspaperdom’s New Superhero: Zip2,
- a new suite of software structures that would enable individual newspapers to quickly mount large-scale city guide-type directories.
- fixing their fucking stupid code
- It’s not your job to make people on your team love you,
- In fact, that’s counterproductive.
- I love, love, love my brother very much, but working with him was hard,
- Growing up in South Africa, fighting was normal,
- It was part of the culture.
- When we had intense stress, we just didn’t notice anyone else around us,
- It was a shitty name.
- We wound up beholden to the papers,
- city.com
- Great things will never happen with VCs or professional managers,
- They don’t have the creativity or the insight.
- This is your first company,
- Let’s find an acquirer and make some money, so you can do your second, third, and fourth company.
- My bank account went from, like, $5,000 to $22,005,000,
- Just three years ago I was showering at the Y and sleeping on the office floor, and now I’ve got a million-dollar car,
- Some could interpret the purchase of this car as behavior characteristic of an imperialist brat,
- My values may have changed, but I’m not consciously aware of my values having changed.
- I was looking for an ostentatious lead character who might warrant skewering,
- But the Musk I met in 2000 was bursting with joie de vivre, too likable to skewer. He had the same insouciance and indifference to expectations he does now, but he was easy, open, charming, and funny.
- I’d like to be on the cover of Rolling Stone,
- I could go and buy one of the islands of the Bahamas and turn it into my personal fiefdom, but I am much more interested in trying to build and create a new company,
- I haven’t spent all my winnings. I’m going to put almost all of it back to a new game.
- The real payoff is the sense of satisfaction in having created a company.
- Yes, yes, yes, but the car as well,
- The car. Let’s be honest.
- What’s her favorite ice cream?
- I think this is your favorite flavor,
- He’s not a man who takes no for an answer,
- I thought the soul patch was a dead giveaway that the guy was a douche,
- So I convinced her to go out with me.
- You have a fire in your soul. I see myself in you.
- Unlike other ambitious people, he never talked about making money,
- He assumed that he would be either wealthy or broke, but nothing in between. What interested him were the problems he wanted to solve.
- Even when it seemed like crazy talk, you would believe him because he believed it.
- because it was far too common and the name of a lot of cheerleaders.
- If Elon ever calls me again, I think I’ll go for it. I might have missed something there.
- Friends would not want to stay at my house because Justine was too grumpy,
- If someone’s insecure, they can be very mean,
- She has no redeeming feature.
- One or two,
- although if I could afford nannies, I’d like to have four.
- That’s the difference between you and me,
- I just assume that there will be nannies.
- Baby.
- For somebody who was so amorous about me, he never hesitated to let me know that I was wrong about something,
- And I would fight back. I realized that I could say anything to him, and it just did not faze him.
- My friend was mortified, but Elon and I were used to having big arguments in public. There is a combative element to him. I don’t think you can be in a relationship with Elon and not argue.
- stupid.
- He was just so adamant and furious that I didn’t know what I was talking about, that I was stupid and crazy,
- It was like the things he told me his father said to him.
- When he told me he was going to marry her, I did an intervention,
- I was like, ‘Don’t, you must not, this is the wrong person for you.’ 
- I think he felt very nervous about getting married and not having this thing signed,
- The villas were open-air, so all of us could hear the row,
- and we didn’t know what to do about it.
- Now you won’t be miserable,
- No, I’m marrying her,
- I am the alpha in this relationship.
- I’m trying to think about what to start next,
- If you fix all the reasons why a consumer would take money out of the system,
- then it will be the place where all the money is, and that would make it a multitrillion-dollar company.
- X
- I am by nature obsessive-compulsive,
- What matters to me is winning, and not in a small way. God knows why… it’s probably rooted in some very disturbing psychoanalytical black hole or neural short circuit.
- Elon Musk Is Poised to Become Silicon Valley’s Next Big Thing,
- today’s Silicon Valley It guy.
- a dick move,
- not running on full thrusters anymore.
- There were several of us playing Street Fighter with Elon,
- He was sweating, and you could see that he was a bundle of energy and intensity.
- I honed the user interface to get the fewest number of keystrokes to open an account,
- Why do we need that?
- Delete!
- It was this crazy competition where we both had insane dollar bonuses to get customers to sign up and refer friends,
- It was a race to see who would run out of money last.
- We would own ninety percent of the merged company and you would own ten percent,
- He had an extremely serious I’m-not-joking look on his face, but underneath there seemed to be an ironic streak,
- We were playing a game.
- This will never hunt, so let’s move on.
- This is just an opening,
- You just have to be patient with a guy like Elon.
- So, what can this car do?
- Watch this,
- At least it showed Peter I was unafraid of risks.
- Yeah, I realized he was a bit crazy.
- If he quit, that would have been a disaster,
- because we were trying to raise more financing just as the internet market was weakening.
- Here was this extreme extrovert business-development type acting like he had an S on his chest, and the three of us are all very nerdy,
- We bonded over being the type of people who would never do what Bill did.
- We have to decide whether we are going to aim big,
- We had a vast amount of traction on eBay,
- Max and Peter thought we should focus entirely on that and become a master merchant service.
- If you want to just be a niche payment system, PayPal is better,
- But if you want to take over the world’s financial system, then X is the better name.
- It was like walking into a mob scene,
- He was surrounded by goonish confidantes. He didn’t have any idea whatsoever about Silicon Valley, but he and his henchmen were eager to line their pockets.
- This guy occupies a different planet,
- Eventually you will see it my way,
- I know how this movie ends.
- No, you’re wrong,
- It just isn’t going to work in Microsoft.
- You know what,
- I will arm-wrestle you for it.
- Just to be clear,
- I’m not going to use your physical weight as any sort of a technical decision input.
- Yeah, I get it.
- We wasted a year doing these technical tap dances instead of building new features,
- The only reason we remained successful was because there were no other companies being funded during that time.
- There’s irony in everything he does,
- He operates on an irony setting that goes up to eleven but never goes below four.
- He turns on his irony flamethrower and creates this sense of exclusive Elon Club membership.
- Elon didn’t just exaggerate, he made it up,
- One by one, we all said, ‘Shit, he’s right,’ 
- Elon will say crazy stuff, but every once in a while, he’ll surprise you by knowing way more than you do about your own specialty. I think a huge part of the way he motivates people are these displays of sharpness, which people just don’t expect from him, because they mistake him for a bullshitter or goofball.
- Fraud Is Love
- It had an extremely depressive effect on me,
- I think I’m done.
- This whole thing is making me so sad that words fail me,
- I have given every last ounce of effort, almost all my cash from Zip2 and put my marriage on the rocks, and yet I stand accused of bad deeds to which I have not even been given an opportunity to respond.
- He described the coup as being ‘heinous,’ 
- I remember, because most people don’t use this word. He labeled it a heinous crime.
- He has reality-warp powers where people get sucked into his vision,
- I took all of my money and put it in this company,
- I have the right to run it.
- That should be only an opening act for creating a real digital bank.
- I told him that I believed his vision of a superbank was toxic, because we needed to focus on our payment service on eBay,
- I’ve decided that the time has come to bring in a seasoned CEO to take X.com to the next level,
- After that search is done, my plan is to take a sabbatical for about three to four months, think through a few ideas, and then start a new company.
- The company was my baby, and like the mother in the Book of Solomon, I was willing to give it up so it could survive,
- I decided to work hard at repairing the relationship with Peter and Max.
- do some PR.
- I’m really the best spokesperson for the company,
- I don’t want to have my honor impugned,
- My honor is worth more than this company to me.
- He was very dramatic,
- People don’t usually talk with such a superheroic, almost Homeric kind of vibe in Silicon Valley.
- Entrepreneurs are actually not risk takers,
- They’re risk mitigators. They don’t thrive on risk, they never seek to amplify it, instead they try to figure out the controllable variables and minimize their risk.
- He was into amplifying risk and burning the boats so we could never retreat from it.
- The Man Who Didn’t Understand the Meaning of the Word ‘Risk.’ 
- He’s amazingly successful getting people to march across a desert,
- He has a level of certainty that causes him to put all of his chips on the table.
- There were all these nerds and sharpsters who were good at memorizing cards and calculating odds,
- Elon just proceeded to go all in on every hand and lose. Then he would buy more chips and double down. Eventually, after losing many hands, he went all in and won. Then he said, ‘Right, fine, I’m done.’ 
- Look at the two companies he went on to build, SpaceX and Tesla,
- Silicon Valley wisdom would be that these were both incredibly crazy bets. But if two crazy companies work that everyone thought couldn’t possibly work, then you say to yourself, ‘I think Elon understands something about risk that everybody else doesn’t.’ 
- You want to have a fist fight behind the school?
- Why did you turn on me?
- I honestly believed it was the right thing to do,
- You were completely wrong, the company was about to die, and I felt I had no other choice.
- Life’s too short,
- Let’s move on.
- I was pretty angry at first,
- I had thoughts of assassination running through my head. But eventually I realized that it was good I got couped. Otherwise I’d still be slaving away at PayPal.
- Of course, if I had stayed, PayPal would be a trillion-dollar company.
- That’s what Twitter could become,
- If you combine a social network with a payments platform, you could create what I wanted X.com to be.
- Jezebel,
- That was the first time I’d ever even heard a woman refer to another woman as a Jezebel,
- I guess the tattoo of the gecko didn’t help.
- He was actually only hours from death,
- His doctor had treated two cases of falciparum malaria prior to treating Elon—both patients died.
- If he had died,
- all of our financial problems were going to be solved.
- We’re happy that he survived and that gradually everything tracked for the company, so we didn’t need the hundred million life insurance policy.
- Vacations will kill you. Also, South Africa. That place is still trying to destroy me.
- I tend to do things very intensely,
- You have a hood on, so you can’t see outside, and you have half your instruments covered,
- Then they shut down one engine, and you have to land the plane. I landed it, but the instructor said, ‘Not good enough. Fail.’ 
- It’s what they used to train their fighter pilots, so it’s incredibly acrobatic,
- But it’s a bit dicey, even for me.
- It was just like in Top Gun. You’re no more than a couple of hundred feet above the ground, following the contour of the mountains. We did a vertical climb up the side of a mountain and then turned upside down.
- It’s not just a simple Bernoulli’s principle,
- I’ve always wanted to do something in space,
- but I don’t think there’s anything that an individual can do.
- By the time we reached the Midtown Tunnel,
- we decided that it was possible.
- I figured it had to be soon, because we went to the moon in 1969, so we must be about to go to Mars.
- It was a big thrill for me because I was a huge fan, but he mainly talked to Elon about Mars and why humans would be doomed if they didn’t colonize other planets.
- I’m going to colonize Mars. My mission in life is to make mankind a multiplanetary civilization.
- Dude, you’re bananas.
- How is this a business?
- What I didn’t appreciate is that Elon starts with a mission and later finds a way to backfill in order to make it work financially,
- That’s what makes him a force of nature.
- Do we want to tell our children that going to the moon is the best we did, and then we gave up?
- People are mistaken when they think that technology just automatically improves,
- It only improves if a lot of people work very hard to make it better.
- But where is everyone?
- We’ve got this delicate candle of consciousness flickering here, and it may be the only instance of consciousness, so it’s essential we preserve it,
- If we are able to go to other planets, the probable lifespan of human consciousness is going to be far greater than if we are stuck on one planet that could get hit by an asteroid or destroy its civilization.
- The United States is literally a distillation of the human spirit of exploration,
- This is a land of adventurers.
- To have a base on Mars would be incredibly difficult, and people will probably die along the way, just as happened in the settling of the United States. But it will be incredibly inspiring, and we must have inspiring things in the world.
- That’s what can get us up in the morning.
- There are only a handful of really big milestones: single-celled life, multicellular life, differentiation of plants and animals, life extending from the oceans to land, mammals, consciousness,
- On that scale, the next important step is obvious: making life multiplanetary.
- One of Elon’s greatest skills is the ability to pass off his vision as a mandate from heaven.
- The probability of success for a rocket company was quite low, and it was even lower if I did not move to Southern California, where the critical mass of aerospace engineering talent was.
- My initial thought was not to create a rocket company, but rather to have a philanthropic mission that would inspire the public and lead to more NASA funding.
- But I became worried that we would end up with a tragicomic video of mice slowly dying on a tiny spaceship.
- So then it came down to, ‘Let’s send a little greenhouse to Mars.’ 
- so all I could make out was that some guy named Ian Musk was saying that he was an internet millionaire and needed to talk to me,
- I want to change mankind’s outlook on being a multiplanetary species,
- Can we meet this weekend?
- I calculated the weight of the food and the weight of the vodka, and they were roughly equal,
- I don’t think I impressed the Russians,
- This rocket was never meant for capitalists to use it for going to Mars on a bullshit mission,
- Who’s your chief engineer?
- Did he just spit on us?
- Yeah, he did,
- I think it’s a sign of disrespect.
- I’m like, ‘Dude, that’s insane,’ 
- They taunted him,
- They said, ‘Oh, little boy, you don’t have the money?’ 
- I was pretty mad, and when I get mad I try to reframe the problem.
- idiot index,
- What the fuck do you think that idiot-savant is doing up there?
- Hey, guys,
- I think we can build this rocket ourselves.
- I’ll be damned—that’s why he’s been borrowing all my books.
- Whoa, dude, ‘I got screwed by the Russians’ does not equal ‘create a launch company,’ 
- They made me watch a reel of rockets exploding, because they wanted to convince me that I would lose all my money,
- If you’re trying to convince me this has a high probability of failure, I am already there,
- The likeliest outcome is that I will lose all my money. But what’s the alternative? That there be no progress in space exploration? We’ve got to give this a shot, or we’re stuck on Earth forever.
- I wanted to hold out hope that humans could be a space-faring civilization and be out there among the stars,
- And there was no chance of that unless a new company was started to create revolutionary rockets.
- We’re going to be doing dumb things, but let’s just not do dumb things on a large scale,
- By the time the paramedics resuscitated him, he had been deprived of oxygen for so long that he was brain-dead,
- He cried like a wolf,
- Cried like a wolf.
- Justine and I tried to draw him into conversations about what happened, but he did not want to talk about it,
- How are you feeling? How are you dealing with it?
- I’ve known him long enough to read his face,
- I could tell he was determined not to talk about it.
- He wasn’t very comfortable with me expressing my feelings over Nevada’s death,
- He told me I was being emotionally manipulative, wearing my heart on my sleeve.
- He shuts down emotions when in dark places,
- I think it’s a survival thing with him.
- Elon was Dad’s first son, and maybe he had something to prove to him,
- We have some bad news,
- Your son wants us to tell you that Nevada, your grandson, has died.
- Dad, you shouldn’t come.
- No, we’re already in the U.S., so we are coming to Los Angeles.
- probably the most amazing thing I have ever seen.
- I don’t want you to go back,
- I will buy you a house here.
- No, no, no, this is a bad idea,
- You’re forgetting that he’s a dark human. Do not do this, do not do this to yourself.
- Watching his own son die, I think that that was what drove him to want his father near him,
- She saw Elon now as the provider in her life and not me,
- and so it became a problematic situation.
- This situation is not working,
- I tried threats, rewards, and arguments to change my father for the better,
- And he—
- No way, it just got worse.
- I made dozens. Of course, they didn’t last long, because I’d always crash them or blow them up.
- As a kid, I was always helping Dad work on his log truck, using the welders and other tools,
- Being hands-on gave me a feel for what would work and what wouldn’t.
- I injected water into it to see what affect doing that had on its performance,
- That’s kind of a crazy thing—adding water gives you more thrust.
- I didn’t come close to winning,
- There were robots and stuff that the other kids’ fathers had built. At least I had done my project myself.
- Oh, my Lord, that’s a tough one,
- It was Super Bowl Sunday, and I had just gotten a widescreen TV and wanted to watch the game with some friends.
- We watched like maybe one play, because we were so engaged in talking about building a launch vehicle,
- I know how to make that work easy,
- You’ll kick yourself if you don’t do this,
- You cannot ask for two years of salary in escrow and consider yourself a cofounder,
- There’s got to be some combination of inspiration, perspiration, and risk to be a cofounder.
- We had been meeting in hotel conference rooms,
- so I started driving through the neighborhoods where most of the aerospace companies are, and I found an old warehouse right near the L.A. airport.
- The people on the assembly line should be able to immediately collar a designer or engineer and say, ‘Why the fuck did you make it this way?’ 
- If your hand is on a stove and it gets hot, you pull it right off, but if it’s someone else’s hand on the stove, it will take you longer to do something.
- If you were negative or thought something couldn’t be done, you were not invited to the next meeting,
- He just wanted people who would make things happen.
- We’d be screaming and yelling at each other like a bunch of lunatics,
- And Elon was right there in the thick of it with us.
- He’s alarmingly good at these games,
- He has insanely fast reactions and knew all the tricks and how to sneak up on people.
- Merlin
- Kestrel
- It was like a painter who paints half your house for one price, then wants three times that for the rest,
- That didn’t make Elon too enthusiastic.
- going Russian
- Let’s go do this ourselves,
- So if the Tesla engine is four times as heavy as your engine, why does yours cost so fucking much?
- the algorithm,
- a requirement
- The military
- The legal department
- We would talk about how we were going to qualify an engine or certify a fuel tank, and he would ask, ‘Why do we have to do that?’ 
- And we would say, ‘There is a military specification that says it’s a requirement.’ And he’d reply, ‘Who wrote that? Why does it make sense?’ 
- How the fuck can it take so long?
- This is stupid. Cut it in half.
- You can’t just take a schedule that we already cut in half and then cut it in half again,
- Then when I ask for something, you fucking give it to me.
- And guess what?
- We ended up developing it in about the time that we had put in that original schedule.
- I learned never to tell him no,
- Just say you’re going to try, then later explain why if it doesn’t work out.
- A maniacal sense of urgency is our operating principle,
- If you set an aggressive schedule that people think they might be able to make, they will try to put out extra effort,
- But if you give them a schedule that’s physically impossible, engineers aren’t stupid. You’ve demoralized them. It’s Elon’s biggest weakness.
- Don’t be afraid, you can do it.
- Even though we failed to meet most schedules or cost targets that Elon laid out, we still beat all of our peers,
- We developed the lowest-cost, most awesome rockets in history, and we would end up feeling pretty good about it, even if Dad wasn’t always happy with us.
- It’s not how well you avoid problems,
- It’s how fast you figure out what the problem is and fix it.
- It was a tedious approach and very expensive,
- Elon told us just to build one engine and fire it up on the test stand; if it worked, put it on a rocket and fly it.
- Okay, now we know what the limits are.
- We need to get the hell out of Mojave,
- California is difficult.
- Holy crap,
- Almost everything we need is here.
- Stop saying how good all this is,
- You’re making it more expensive.
- rapid unscheduled disassemblies,
- Nah, just fix it,
- Go up there with some hammers and just pound it back out, weld it, and we’ll keep going.
- When he showed up, we began testing the tank with gas in it, and it held,
- Elon believes that every situation is salvageable. That taught us a lot. And it actually was fun.
- First one, then two, then three of our first chambers cracked,
- It was a disaster.
- We can’t throw them away,
- There’s no way to fix them,
- He’s the boss,
- cow cam
- mouthy
- I want to be like her,
- I applied because of Northwestern’s richness in other fields,
- I was terrified of being tagged as a nerd. Now I’m super proud to be one.
- I must have really sucked eggs on the interview.
- Come on in,
- You can meet Elon.
- He knew the details,
- The guy you have doing discussions with possible customers is a loser,
- I’ve been a fucking idiot,
- I’ll take the job.
- People like Elon with Asperger’s don’t take social cues and don’t naturally think about the impact of what they say on other people,
- Elon understands personalities very well, but as a study, not as an emotion.
- Elon is not an ass, and yet sometimes he will say things that are very assholey,
- He just doesn’t think about the personal impact of what he’s saying. He just wants to fulfill the mission.
- Part of my job is to tend to the wounded,
- I’m not at his level, but I’m not an idiot. I understand the stuff he’s saying,
- I listen hard, take him seriously, read his intentions, and try to achieve what he wants, even if what he is saying seems crazy initially.
- he tends to be right,
- They work their asses off, but they are chickenshits around Elon.
- It was the funniest thing, watching him try to hide it.
- SpaceX presents good products and solid potential,
- NASA investment in this venture is well warranted.
- financial arrangements are shaky
- Everyone told me that it might mean we would never be able to work with NASA,
- But what they did was wrong and corrupt, so I sued.
- That was a huge upset—literally imagine, like, a ten-to-one odds underdog winning,
- It blew everyone’s mind.
- cost-plus
- Boeing and Lockheed just want their cost-plus gravy trains,
- You just can’t get to Mars with that system. They have an incentive never to finish. If you never finish a cost-plus contract, then you suckle on the tit of the government forever.
- It rewards results rather than waste,
- What if we could put a thousand or ten thousand together?
- We’ve got to do this,
- led by the spirit of free enterprise.
- Harold was a legend in the space industry, so I invited them to come visit the SpaceX factory,
- stupid
- Elon is quick to form opinions,
- It was a great conversation because Harold and JB are very interesting people, even though the idea was dumb.
- I was looking for funding and being rather shameless,
- I was going to work on high-density energy storage at Stanford,
- I was trying to think of what would have the most effect on the world, and energy storage along with electric vehicles were high on my list.
- Count me in,
- Sergei Brin and JB Straubel both suggested you might be interested in driving our tzero sports car,
- We ran it against a Viper last Monday and it won 4 of 5 sprints on a ⅛ mile track. I lost one because I was carrying a 300 lb cameraman. Do you have time for me to bring it by?
- Sure,
- I would really enjoy seeing it. Don’t think it could beat my McLaren (yet), though.
- Hmm, a McLaren, boy that would be a feather in my cap,
- I can have it there on Feb 4th.
- You have to turn this into a real product,
- That could really change the world.
- Nobody is going to pay anywhere near that for something that looks like crap,
- Gage and Cocconi were sort of madcap inventors,
- Common sense was not their strong suit.
- Everyone thinks electric cars suck, but you can show that they don’t,
- Okay, if you guys don’t want to commercialize tzero, do you mind if I do?
- be like every other guy going through a midlife crisis and buy myself a sports car.
- Climate change had become real to me,
- plus I felt we kept fighting wars in the Middle East because of our need for oil.
- I worked through the exact math each step of the way, from when fuels come out of the ground to when they power the car.
- That really shook me up,
- They were smart people, but I soon realized that they were incapable of actually building cars,
- That’s when I decided I had to start a car company of my own.
- I wanted to make a sporty roadster that would absolutely change the way that people think about electric cars,
- and then use it to build a brand.
- I’m giving up on Elon,
- You should give him a call.
- I buttonholed him afterwards just to say hi, like a fanboy,
- We would love to talk to you about Tesla Motors, particularly if you might be interested in investing,
- I believe that you have driven AC Propulsion’s tzero car. If so, you already know that a high-performance electric car can be made. We would like to convince you that we can do so profitably.
- Sure.
- He clearly had already come to the conclusion that to have a sustainable future we had to electrify cars.
- Come on, you’ve got to do this,
- It will be a perfect fit.
- He was a polite British guy and couldn’t find a way to tell us to go away,
- When we were done, he was intrigued enough to invite us to the U.K.
- To make a mule required a lot of hacking and slashing in order to jam our batteries and the AC Propulsion powertrain into a Lotus Elise,
- But at least we had a thing that looked like a real car. It actually had doors and a roof, unlike the tzero.
- Elon called himself the chief architect and all kinds of things, but he wasn’t,
- He was just a board member and investor.
- When I met Eberhard and Wright and Tarpenning, they had no intellectual property, no employees, nothing. All they had was a shell corporation.
- I was running SpaceX,
- and I had no desire to also run Tesla.
- The number of great product people in the world is tiny and I think you are one of them.
- I was never his drinking buddy,
- but we were in each other’s houses every now and then and went out to eat.
- Martin and Ian were telling me why the other one is a demon and needs to be thrown out,
- They are saying, ‘Elon, you must make a choice.’ 
- Okay, who should we pick here?
- Maybe Martin is the lesser of two evils.
- We had planned to do the minimal possible modifications,
- at least until Elon got more involved.
- We only get to release our first car once, so we want it to be as good as it can be,
- We couldn’t have a crappy-looking car and sell it for around a hundred thousand dollars,
- I had never designed a car before, so I was studying every great car and trying to understand what made it special,
- In order to get in the car, you had to be a dwarf mountain climber or a master contortionist,
- It was insane, farcical.
- If you’re going on a date, how is a woman even going to get in the car?
- My original idea was to use the same seat structures that Lotus used,
- Otherwise, we would have to redo all the testing. But Elon felt that the seats were too narrow for his wife’s butt or something. I got a skinny butt, and I kind of miss the narrow seats.
- It made the car look bug-eyed,
- The lights are like the eyes of a car, and you have to have beautiful eyes.
- If you’re buying a sports car, you’re buying it because it’s beautiful,
- So this is not a small deal.
- Dude, you could make the body panels for at least 500 cars worth per year if you bought the soft oven we have at SpaceX!
- If someone tells you this is hard, they are full of shit. You can make high quality composites in the oven in your home.
- Somebody who’s buying a Tesla Roadster will buy it whether it has ordinary door latches or electric ones,
- It’s not going to add a single unit to our sales.
- This is a major issue and I’m deeply concerned that you do not recognize it as such,
- I just don’t see a path—any path at all—to fixing it prior to start of production without a significant cost and schedule hit,
- I stay up at night worrying about simply getting the car into production sometime in 2007…. For my own sanity’s sake and for the sanity of my team, I am not spending a lot of cycles thinking about the dashboard.
- I was driving the Lotus people crazy,
- They kept asking me why I was being so hardcore about every little curve of this car. And what I told them was, ‘Because we have to make it beautiful.’ 
- This was sooner than we had originally planned, largely because we had been making these hires that Elon pushed for,
- So Elon totally loses it.
- Elon,
- if you take away the costs of the six unbudgeted new hires that you pushed for, then they would actually still be right on target.
- Okay,
- I guess we should figure out how to raise more financing.
- It was an absolutely bone-jarring ride with Elon at the wheel in this tiny car with no suspension that went from zero to sixty in less time than it takes to blink,
- How much more terrifying can that be?
- I really admired that ride, but we’re not going to compete against Toyota,
- It’s mission impossible.
- I didn’t appreciate the strength of Elon’s determination.
- The duality of the management with Eberhard and Musk concerned me,
- but I realized it was just the nature of this beast.
- Tesla Motors was founded in June 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning,
- We are proud of Mr. Musk’s continued confidence in Tesla Motors expressed through his strong participation in every round of financing and his leadership on the Board of Directors.
- created the first electric sports car.
- Why is Elon doing these interviews?
- You’re the CEO.
- He wants to do them,
- and I don’t want to be arguing with him.
- Things went really badly,
- He went into every detail, including how much we planned to spend on catering. When I fought back, his whole body jerked away, and he stood up and walked out of the room.
- He shit all over her ideas and then told me to fire her.
- You can have a car that’s quick, and you can have a car that’s electric, but having one that’s both is how you make electric cars popular,
- Until today, all electric cars sucked,
- Tesla executives are not paid high salaries, and we don’t issue dividends. All free cash flow goes completely into driving the technology to lower costs and make cars that are more affordable.
- This is not your father’s electric car,
- The $100,000 vehicle, with its sports car looks, is more Ferrari than Prius—and more about testosterone than granola.
- He set out to build a sleek, battery-powered performance machine,
- After reading biographies of John DeLorean and Preston Tucker, and reminding himself that launching a car company was a crazy idea, he did just that.
- The way that my role has been portrayed to date, where I am referred to merely as ‘an early investor,’ is outrageous,
- That would be like Martin being called an ‘early employee.’ My influence on the car itself runs from the headlights to the styling to the door sill to the trunk, and my strong interest in electric transport predates Tesla by a decade. Martin should certainly be the front and center guy, but the portrayal of my role to date has been incredibly insulting.
- like to talk with every major publication within reason.
- Zero to 60 in 4 Seconds,
- I was incredibly insulted and embarrassed by the NY Times article,
- I am not merely unmentioned, but Martin is actually referred to as the chairman. If anything like this happens again, please consider the PCGC relationship with Tesla to end immediately.
- The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me),
- My mind is not easily blown, but this place and this guy were amazing,
- Creating engineering this good is the beautiful part,
- It’s electric,
- There’s no way you can beat it.
- The Air Force and us were such a mismatch,
- They had some requirements that Elon and I laughed about so hard that we would have to catch our breath.
- They probably laughed at us the same way.
- It’s like something out of Catch-22,
- A person at the Pentagon decides to pick someone named Major Mango to run a tropical island base.
- I thought he was nuts,
- Hey, did you just hang up on me?
- So Major Mango was rolling out the red carpet for us, while the Air Force was giving us the cold shoulder at Vandenberg,
- Let’s go to Kwaj.
- I did not realize what a shitshow it would be dealing with the logistics and the salt air,
- Every now and then you shoot yourself in the foot. If you had to pick a path that reduced the probability of success, it would be to launch from an inaccessible tropical island.
- Those four years on Kwaj forged us, bonded us, and taught us to work as a team.
- Outsweat, Outdrink, Outlaunch.
- Want to go for a bike ride?
- No, I need to go to the control center,
- The launch isn’t until later. Let’s go for a ride. It will be a stress reliever.
- Robotaxis
- We were right smack in the middle of a count, and he just wanted to have this deep, aggressive conversation about materials,
- I was absolutely dumbfounded that he was not even aware that we were trying to launch a rocket, and that I was the launch conductor, and responsible for basically calling out every single command that we’re going to run. It just blew me away.
- It launched!
- It really launched!
- Oh, shit,
- We’re losing thrust.
- Oh, shit,
- There’s a fire, a leak.
- My stomach wrenched,
- When we started, we all knew we could fail on the first mission,
- But we will build another rocket and try again.
- We put the pieces in a hangar and pieced them together as we tried to figure out what went wrong,
- Do you know how many people told me I should fire you?
- Why don’t you just fire me?
- I didn’t fucking fire you, did I?
- You’re still fucking here.
- SpaceX is in this for the long haul. Come hell or high water, we are going to make this work.
- one of our most experienced technicians,
- I’m the CEO,
- I’m the one that deals with the press, so stay out of it.
- We lost a good guy.
- Yes, yes! We’ve made it,
- Congratulations,
- I’m going to watch that video for a long time.
- I knew right away it was slosh,
- Catch it, catch it,
- From now on,
- we are going to have eleven items on our risk list, never just ten.
- I find this a rather awkward situation where Elon has asked for Lotus’ own view of the production timing,
- I hiked through the mud to this building, where I saw that the Lotus guys were right, the body tooling wasn’t working,
- It was a total failure.
- I realized that if you invest in a company, you should spend all your time on the shop floor,
- It’s not the product that leads to success. It’s the ability to make the product efficiently. It’s about building the machine that builds the machine. In other words, how do you design the factory?
- Elon and I looked at each other and said, we can’t leave this poor driver with vomit in his car,
- Elon has Asperger’s,
- so he sometimes comes across as not emotional, but he actually can care.
- I thought for a moment that they might rob me,
- We could get twenty-four hours of production for sixteen hours of labor each day,
- I’m getting in my plane. I will pick you up in Chicago, and we’ll go sort this out,
- Please don’t strike or go on vacation right now, or Tesla will die,
- It was just a flat-out burning dumpster fire of stupidity,
- In retrospect it would have been much smarter to start with a clean-sheet design and not try to modify the Lotus Elise,
- We screwed the pooch six ways to Sunday,
- You can’t manufacture a product without a bill of materials,
- There are tens of thousands of components on a vehicle, and you are getting pecked to death by ducks.
- It was,
- an oh-shit moment.
- This is not going to work,
- Eberhard is not being for real about the numbers.
- Let’s start a search to find someone who can replace me,
- Nobody will be able to take from you the importance of what you’ve done by being a founder of this company,
- Tesla’s sheer number of problems was so high that it was nearly impossible to try to find a decent CEO,
- It’s hard to find a buyer for a house that’s on fire.
- What’s your best estimate for the cost of the car?
- He lied to me and said the cost would be no problem,
- That’s slanderous,
- I wouldn’t lie to anybody. Why would I do that? The true cost is going to come out eventually.
- This is the richest man in the world beating on somebody who can’t touch him.
- Certainly, it wasn’t deliberate,
- We were dealing with the pricing information that we had. We weren’t lying.
- It was like getting hit by a brick on the side of the head, something I never saw coming,
- They had had a meeting without me to vote me off the island.
- It was unanimous board agreement that Martin had to go, including the members Martin had put on the board,
- trying to root out and destroy any of its heart that might still be beating.
- Getting involved with Eberhard was the worst mistake I ever made in my career,
- Musk has set out to re-write history,
- What the fuck?
- The company that Marc and I started turned him into the richest man in the world. Isn’t that enough already?
- Tesla is alive in spite of Eberhard, but he seeks credit constantly & fools give it him.
- He is literally the worst person I have ever worked with.
- Founding story of Tesla as portrayed by Eberhard is patently false. I wish I had never met him.
- We’d have some wine and shoot the breeze,
- Why are we bringing all these materials in?
- Because Elon keeps insisting that we will be shipping cars in January.
- Elon is just not a very nice person and didn’t treat people well,
- I told him that people won’t tell him the truth, because he intimidates people,
- He could be a bully and brutal.
- He’s somewhere on the spectrum, so I think he honestly doesn’t have any connection with people at all,
- Michael Marks would not fire anyone,
- I would tell him, Michael, you can’t tell people they have to get their shit together, and then when they don’t get their shit together nothing happens to them.
- That’s just the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard,
- He treated me like a child, and I’m not a child,
- I’m older than he is. I had also run a twenty-five-billion-dollar company.
- I’ve come to put him in the same category as Steve Jobs, which is that some people are just assholes, but they accomplish so much that I just have to sit back and say, ‘That seems to be a package.’ 
- Maybe if the price the world pays for this kind of accomplishment is a real asshole doing it, well, it’s probably a price worth paying. That’s how I’ve come to think about it, anyway.
- But I wouldn’t want to be that way.
- The only person who would actually agree to be CEO of Tesla was someone who was afraid of nothing, because there was a lot to be afraid of,
- I’ve got to have both hands on the steering wheel,
- I can’t have two of us driving.
- I get choked up talking about it,
- There were moments of being just totally content, like totally.
- We went to black-tie fundraisers and got the best tables at elite Hollywood nightclubs, with Paris Hilton and Leonardo DiCaprio partying next to us,
- When Google cofounder Larry Page got married on Richard Branson’s private Caribbean island, we were there, hanging out in a villa with John Cusack and watching Bono pose with swarms of adoring women.
- If you were my employee, I would fire you.
- a moron
- an idiot,
- When I spent some time with Errol,
- I realized that’s where he’d gotten the vocabulary.
- Elon fights in a high-intensity way,
- And Justine could go to the mat as well. You watch it and you’re like, holy moly, this is brutal. I ended up distancing myself from him for years because of Justine. I just could not be around it.
- It was basically a massive cluster fuck of disruptive things,
- trophy wife,
- I sucked at it.
- Go platinum,
- I met him when he didn’t have much at all,
- The accumulation of wealth and fame changed the dynamic.
- He’s strong-willed and powerful, like a bear,
- He can be playful and funny and romp around with you, but in the end you’re still dealing with a bear.
- He didn’t share these things with me,
- I don’t think it occurred to him that maybe it would’ve been very helpful. He was in such a combative relationship with the world. All he had to do was clue me in.
- He’s a great man in a lot of ways,
- but it’s that lack of empathy that always gives me pause.
- No, it has nothing to do with thinking or analysis or reading the other person,
- It involves feeling. You feel the other person.
- The strong will and emotional distance that makes him difficult as a husband,
- may be reasons for his success in running a business.
- When you’re from a dysfunctional background or have a brain wired like his,
- intensity takes the place of intimacy.
- She went from having some highs and lows to just being angry every day,
- I was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder, and Adderall was an amazing help for me,
- But it wasn’t the reason I was angry. I was angry because Elon shut me out.
- I didn’t want to be a sideline player in the multimillion-dollar spectacle of my husband’s life,
- I wanted to love and be loved, the way we had before he made all his millions.
- I’m willing to stay married, but you have to promise not to be mean to me all the time.
- I felt numb,
- but strangely relieved.
- I was trying to snap Elon out of his mood,
- He seemed quite shy and slightly awkward,
- He was talking about rockets, and at first I didn’t realize they were his rockets.
- May I put my hand on your knee?
- I’m very bad at this, but please may I have your phone number because I would like to see you again.
- This man is married and has five children,
- You’ve been taken in by some playboy.
- We ended up having breakfast together,
- and at the end he said, ‘I’d really like to see you for lunch.’ And then after lunch that day, he said, ‘Well, that was really wonderful. Now I’d like to see you for dinner.’ 
- They were love birds, holding hands the entire time,
- I’m really sorry I don’t have a ring,
- I remember swimming around with him in the rooftop pool, very giddy, talking about how strange it was that we had known each other for about two weeks and were now engaged.
- What’s the worst that could happen to us?
- One of us could die.
- I know my daughter very well, and I trust her judgment, so off you go,
- She was an absolute delight, funny and loving and successful,
- And her parents were so nice, a really good English couple.
- I believed that if we couldn’t do it in three,
- we deserved to die.
- Third time a charm!
- SpaceX will not skip a beat in execution going forward,
- There should be absolutely zero question that SpaceX will prevail in reaching orbit. I will never give up, and I mean never.
- It was the shittiest period of my life, given what was happening with my marriage, SpaceX, and Tesla,
- I didn’t even have a house. Justine had it.
- He told us to go for it,
- and it blew me away.
- I think most of us would have followed him into the gates of hell carrying suntan oil after that,
- Within moments, the energy of the building went from despair and defeat to a massive buzz of determination.
- Optimism, pessimism, fuck that,
- We’re going to make it happen. As God is my bloody witness, I’m hell-bent on making it work.
- P1 arriving now!
- P1
- Even though I now had a Roadster,
- it was the beginning of the most painful year of my life.
- We either do this or we die.
- I need you to put it into Tesla,
- Sorry, but I have to do it,
- That’s how bad 2008 was,
- God bless Jeff Skoll, who gave Elon money to see him through,
- I was very upset and called Mommy and Daddy, and they said they would remortgage their house and try to help,
- Your parents shouldn’t lose their house just because I put in everything I had,
- I kept thinking he was going to have a heart attack,
- He was having night terrors and just screaming in his sleep and clawing at me. It was horrendous. I was really scared, and he was just desperate.
- It would go to his gut, and he would be screaming and retching,
- I would stand by the toilet and hold his head.
- I was working every day, all day and night, in a situation that required me to pull a rabbit out of the hat, now do it again, now do it again,
- Dude, why don’t you fucking just give up on one of these two things?
- If SpaceX speaks to your heart, throw Tesla away.
- No,
- that would be another notch in the signpost of ‘Electric cars don’t work,’ and we’d never get to sustainable energy.
- We might then never be a multiplanetary species.
- For me emotionally, this was like, you got two kids and you’re running out of food,
- You can give half to each kid, in which case they might both die, or give all the food to one kid and increase the chance that at least one kid survives. I couldn’t bring myself to decide that one was going to die, so I decided I had to give my all to save both.
- categorically skeptical about clean tech,
- At one point I asked Elon whether we could speak to the company’s chief rocket engineer,
- and Elon replied, ‘You’re speaking to him right now.’ 
- I argued that what Elon was trying to do was amazing, and we should be a part of it,
- Part of my thinking was that it would be a way to patch things up from the PayPal saga,
- It was an interesting exercise in karma,
- After I got assassinated by the PayPal coup leaders, like Caesar being stabbed in the Senate, I could have said ‘You guys, you suck.’ But I didn’t. If I’d done that, Founders Fund wouldn’t have come through in 2008 and SpaceX would be dead. I’m not into astrology or shit like that. But karma may be real.
- Well, then, just do it,
- I ended up figuring out how to change my brain from doing music to doing engineering,
- We’re like looking at each other, like, this seems weird,
- And then we get another bang, and we saw the side of the rocket tank crumpling like a Coke can.
- Here’s this big Turkish guy screaming at the Air Force pilots, who were the whitest Americans you have ever seen, to go back higher,
- All of us standing there could just hear this pause,
- He is silent for a minute. Then he’s like, ‘No, you’re going to get it to Kwaj and fix it there.’ 
- Man, we’re doomed.
- We began telling ourselves, ‘We’re going to make this work.’ 
- So we were now used to moving a little bit slower, with more documentation and checks,
- Okay,
- Go as fast as you can.
- This is something that we had to learn, which was that Elon would make a statement, but then time would go on and he would realize, ‘Oh no, actually we can do it this other way,’ 
- It was unlike anything that the bloated companies in the aerospace industry could possibly have imagined,
- Sometimes his insane deadlines make sense.
- Fourth time’s a charm!
- We wouldn’t be able to get any new funding for Tesla,
- People would be like, ‘Look at that guy whose rocket company failed, he’s a loser.’ 
- That was frigging awesome,
- Fourth time’s a charm!
- My mind is kind of frazzled, so it’s hard for me to say anything,
- This is just the first step of many. We’re going to get Falcon 9 to orbit next year, get the Dragon spacecraft going, and take over from the Space Shuttle. We’re going to do a lot of things, even getting to Mars.
- My cortisol levels, my stress hormones, the adrenaline, they were just so high that it was hard for me to feel happy,
- There was a sense of relief, like being spared from death, but no joy. I was way too stressed for that.
- ilovenasa
- Like Roger Bannister besting the four-minute mile, SpaceX made people recalibrate their sense of limitation when it came to getting to space,
- NASA is worried that I have to split my time between SpaceX and Tesla,
- I kind of need a partner.
- Do you want to be president of SpaceX?
- I’ll focus on engineering and product development,
- and I want you to focus on customer management, human resources, government affairs, and a lot of the finance.
- I love working with people, and he loves working with hardware and designs,
- I love NASA,
- You guys rock.
- ilovenasa.
- It would help fund Tesla’s growth,
- Salzman was trying to insist that we hitch our wagon to a legacy car company,
- and I’m like, that ship is literally sinking.
- People thought they put down a deposit, not an unsecured loan to fund the company. Morally, it was wrong.
- He was tough on people and needlessly insensitive. That was just part of his DNA. It didn’t sit well with me.
- I was furious at what these evil fools were trying to do to Elon,
- I started yelling, ‘No way, no way, you’re not doing this. You guys are fools.’ 
- Nope, we’ve got Elon’s back,
- He was trying to perform open-heart surgery, and we were trying to make sure that he wasn’t putting in the wrong blood type,
- When you have one person with inordinate control, and that person is under a lot of stress, that’s a dicey situation.
- We’ve got to do this right away or we’ll miss payroll,
- I’m a night owl, I’m like, oh man, this is fucked,
- Salzman was doing this to me because he is a dickhead.
- He is such a douche,
- When I say he is a douchebag, that is descriptive, not pejorative.
- We did not have any scheme to take over the company or force it into bankruptcy,
- That’s absurd. Our role is simply to support a company and make sure its capital is spent wisely.
- He has been a singular driving force behind the company, and I’ll give him credit that it worked out. I doff my hat.
- I was on the floor wrapping presents for the kids, and Elon was on the bed, on the phone, frantically trying to sort this thing out,
- Christmas for me is very important, so my priority was to buffer the kids from the situation. I kept saying, ‘It’s Christmas, there’ll be some sort of miracle.’ 
- Had it gone the other way, Tesla would have been dead,
- and maybe too the dream of electric cars for many years.
- bailed out
- subsidized
- the bailout.
- We had to spend money and then submit invoices to the government,
- I remember them being very grumpy and wanting to get out of there as soon as possible,
- They were expecting some lame PowerPoint presentation.
- What do you mean?
- That Smart car hauled ass,
- You could do wheelies in that car.
- If Daimler had not invested in Tesla at that time we would have died,
- In a sports car, the lines and proportions are like that of a supermodel, and it’s relatively easy to make that good looking,
- But the proportions of a sedan are harder to make pleasing.
- looks like a fucking egg on wheels,
- Lower the roof.
- Imagine you’re at a fashion show with Giorgio Armani,
- A model who is six feet tall and weighs a hundred pounds comes in wearing a dress. You’re with your wife and she is five feet tall and weighs a hundred fifty pounds, and you say to Armani, ‘Make that dress for my wife.’ It won’t look the same.
- I don’t care what you want,
- I’m ordering you to do these things.
- I’m not really a Musk type of guy,
- I’m pretty laid back.
- a rinse-and-repeat cycle
- Shit, he’s launching rockets into space,
- Cars are easy compared to this.
- That is really no good,
- I can make you something great.
- Yes, let’s do it,
- Armageddon was hitting,
- and there were days when I thought, man, we may not survive to even be able to show this cool car we’re dreaming about.
- Dave, you don’t realize how bootstrap this organization is,
- This is like a garage band. We may be going bankrupt.
- If he’s this hardcore about rockets and he wants to do cars,
- then I want to do this.
- We spent a lot of time shaving millimeters from the battery pack so that we could ensure that you had enough headroom without making it a bubble car,
- How many battery cells do we need to get to our range target?
- We had run dozens of models, looking at how good the aerodynamics could be, how efficient we could get the drivetrain, and how energy dense we could make each of the cells,
- No,
- Do it with 7,200 cells.
- He was really harsh,
- He likes to challenge the messenger, which isn’t always the best approach. He began attacking me.
- I never want to be in another meeting with Elon.
- great
- That’s the kind of feedback we need,
- You just have to learn how to deal with his demands. Figure out what his goal is, and keep giving him information. That’s how he gets the best outcomes.
- The crazy thing about his 7,200 target was we indeed ended up with 7,200 cells,
- It was a gut calculus, but he nailed it.
- Elon would get personal and the engineers would freak out,
- They’d feel that they were being asked to do something unsafe.
- Elon is a hypercompetitive guy, and challenging him means that a meeting can go to hell.
- At other places I worked,
- there was this throw-it-over-the-fence mentality, where a designer would have an idea and then send it to an engineer, who sat in a different building or in a different country.
- The vision was that we would create designers who thought like engineers and engineers who thought like designers,
- In most people’s vocabularies, design means veneer,
- Nothing could be further from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers.
- If there’s this handle on it, it makes a relationship possible,
- It’s approachable. It gives you permission to touch.
- The handle senses your approach, lights up, pops out to greet you, and it’s magical,
- stupid.
- Stop fighting me on this,
- What the fuck is this?
- Get rid of them,
- People aren’t stupid. These stickers are stupid.
- We were amazed at how we could add tons of functionality over the years, including more acceleration,
- It allowed the car to get better than when you originally bought it.
- I have a good neural net when it comes to assessing with just a few questions a person’s ability to perform,
- I asked the general if we could buy it,
- and we got a $1.5 million pressure vessel for scrap. It’s still at Pad 40.
- I’ve been told we should extend the Space Shuttle program. Is that right?
- No,
- The private sector should do this.
- I was not an ideologue like many around me who felt that all we need to do is take NASA’s budget, take everything for human spaceflight, and give it to Elon Musk and SpaceX,
- Senior industry and government officials took pleasure deriding SpaceX and Elon,
- It didn’t help that Elon was younger and richer than they were, with a Silicon Valley disrupter mentality and lack of deference toward the traditional industry.
- over budget, behind schedule, off course, and unexecutable.
- The president’s proposed NASA budget begins the death march for the future of U.S. human spaceflight,
- Essentially the U.S. has decided that they’re not going to be a significant player in human space flight.
- Some have said it is unfeasible or unwise to work with the private sector in this way,
- I disagree. By buying the services of space transportation—rather than the vehicles themselves—we can continue to ensure rigorous safety standards are met. But we will also accelerate the pace of innovations as companies—from young startups to established leaders—compete to design and build and launch new means of carrying people and materials out of our atmosphere.
- All of us at the White House were in agreement that we wanted to go to the SpaceX pad.
- I thought he was a moderate but also someone willing to force change,
- I think he wanted to get a sense if I was dependable or a little nuts.
- a little nuts,
- A dramatic launch failure could further undercut an already faltering campaign by the White House to persuade Congress to spend billions to help SpaceX and perhaps two other rivals to develop commercial replacements for NASA’s retiring Space Shuttle fleet.
- Our antenna got wet,
- and we weren’t getting a good telemetry signal.
- You think it is good enough to fly tomorrow?
- It should do the trick.
- Okay, let’s do it.
- It wasn’t the right sort of pattern,
- It’s good enough,
- Let’s launch.
- The important thing with Elon,
- is that if you told him the risks and showed him the engineering data, he would make a quick assessment and let the responsibility shift from your shoulders to his.
- a vindication of what the president has proposed.
- Everyone at NASA assumed we’d be standing down from the launch for a few weeks,
- The usual plan would have been to replace the entire engine.
- What if we just cut the skirt?
- Like, literally cut around it?
- NASA couldn’t do anything but accept SpaceX’s decisions and watch in disbelief,
- It’s like the spacecraft equivalent of the Heimlich maneuver,
- I can take a hard path
- When he’s angry, he’s angry, and when he’s joyful, he’s joyful, and he’s almost childlike in his enthusiasms,
- He can be very cold, but he feels things in a very pure way, with a depth that most people don’t get.
- the child within the man.
- When we went to the cinema, he would get so caught up with a silly movie that he would stare in rapture at the screen with his mouth slightly open laughing, then he would actually end up on the floor rolling around, holding his belly.
- I remember one of those nights, he began crying, and it was really horrendous for him,
- He was almost not conscious, not in the room with me, when he told me these things,
- Being with me can be difficult,
- This will be a hard path.
- Okay,
- I can take a hard path.
- I’m Christian, and Elon is not, but he very kindly agreed to get married in a cathedral,
- full-on princess dress from Vera Wang,
- There shall be hovercraft and eels.
- My hovercraft is full of eels.
- It was quite difficult,
- because you need permits to transport eels between England and Scotland, but in the end we did have an amphibious little hovercraft and eels.
- We all got to be young boys again,
- So I used to throw very theatrical parties just to keep him entertained,
- People were hanging from the ceiling,
- which was a bizarre scene in the very traditional Orient Express train car.
- My Name Is Tallulah
- I don’t really sing, so it was traumatic for me, but I did it for him,
- the machine that builds the machine
- OCD is one of the reasons for their success, because they obsessed on solving a problem until they did,
- Steve just had to get the conception and software right, but the manufacturing was outsourced,
- Elon took on the manufacturing, the materials, the huge factories.
- The brain strain of designing the car is tiny compared to the brain strain of designing the factory,
- Fuck oil,
- Jesus Christ, is this the best we can do?
- The panel gap finish is crap. The paint quality is crap. Why aren’t we getting the same production quality as Mercedes and BMW?
- It taught me how all the things you create on the drawing board have an effect at the other end, on the assembly line,
- hardcore.
- Ultra hardcore.
- Please prepare yourself for a level of intensity that is greater than anything most of you have experienced before. Revolutionizing industries is not for the faint of heart.
- Tesla Model S, Shocking Winner: Proof Positive That America Can Still Make (Great) Things.
- It drives like a sports car, eager and agile and instantly responsive. But it’s also as smoothly effortless as a Rolls-Royce, can carry almost as much stuff as a Chevy Equinox, and is more efficient than a Toyota Prius. Oh, and it’ll sashay up to the valet at a luxury hotel like a supermodel working a Paris catwalk.
- the astonishing inflection point the Model S represents
- It was a completely wacky idea,
- It seemed like science fiction crazy.
- What began as a showstopper problem,
- became a really fun blue-sky wacky brainstorming opportunity to say, ‘Wow, this is actually a chance to do something unique.’ 
- We had no clue how to build a battery factory.
- It was a come-to-Jesus session where we had to make him truly commit that we were going to build the insane Gigafactory together,
- Elon can be so much hell and brimstone in meetings and just unpredictable as all get out,
- But I’ve also seen him flip a switch and suddenly be this incredibly effective, charismatic, high-emotional-intelligence business person, when he has to do it.
- I was mildly shocked and impressed, because, whoa, this is not like how Elon usually was on other days,
- He’s a person who’s all over the map, and you don’t know what he’s going to say or do. And then, all of a sudden, he pulls it all together.
- We are too conservative. We are a ninety-five-year-old company. We have to change. We have to use some of Elon’s thinking.
- a seminal moment
- Space, the final frontier, meet me there!
- How is the situation in the year 2000 different from 1960?
- What’s different is computer sensors, cameras, software. Being able to land vertically is the kind of problem that can be addressed by technologies that didn’t exist in 1960.
- I don’t think stasis is compatible with liberty,
- We can fix that problem in exactly one way: by moving out into the solar system.
- Dude, we tried that and that turned out to be really dumb, so I’m telling you don’t do the dumb thing we did.
- Ten, nine, eight…
- when they haven’t even gotten so much as a toothpick to orbit.
- If they do somehow show up in the next five years with a vehicle qualified to NASA’s human rating standards that can dock with the Space Station, which is what Pad 39A is meant to do, we will gladly accommodate their needs,
- Frankly, I think we are more likely to discover unicorns dancing in the flame duct.
- A fully reusable rocket is the difference between being a single-planet civilization and being a multiplanet one.
- You are kind enough not to show our first three launches,
- We’ll have to have a blooper reel at some point.
- That’s the thing that will allow us to establish life on Mars,
- Our upcoming launch will have landing legs on the rocket for the first time.
- but I suspect there are people in this room who would.
- Sea landing of space launch vehicles,
- methods for landing and recovering a booster stage and/or other portions thereof on a platform at sea.
- is something that’s been discussed for, like, half a century,
- It’s in fictional movies; it’s in multiple proposals; there’s so much prior art, it’s crazy. So, trying to patent something that people have been discussing for half a century is obviously ridiculous.
- Grasshopper.
- They’re sitting around seriously discussing plans to build a city on Mars and what people will wear there,
- and everyone’s just acting like this is a totally normal conversation.
- You can’t,
- Too dangerous.
- We’re going,
- If it’s going to explode, we might as well walk through burning debris. How often do you get to do that?
- Sure,
- Given the options,
- I prefer to learn from success.
- Full reuse is a game changer,
- The rarest of beasts—a used rocket. Controlled landing not easy but done right can look easy.
- @JeffBezos Not quite ‘rarest.’ SpaceX Grasshopper rocket did 6 suborbital flights 3 years ago & is still around.
- The Falcon has landed
- Elon kept hammering at us to eke out a tiny percent more efficiency by chilling down the fuel more and more,
- It was ingenious, but it was giving us a real pain in the ass.
- There is no first-principles reason this can’t work,
- It’s extraordinarily difficult, I know, but you just have to muscle through.
- I was just crapping in my pants during the countdown,
- I was scared as hell,
- If it was my company, I would have shut it down.
- You got to call this one,
- Fuck it,
- Let’s just go.
- I thought he had done some complex quick calculations to decide what to do, but in fact he just shrugged his shoulders and gave the order. He had an intuition of what the physics were.
- Come on down, come on down slowly,
- Oh shit,
- The Falcon has landed.
- It’s standing on the pad!
- Holy fucking shit,
- Holy fucking shit.
- We just launched and landed the biggest rocket in the world!
- USA, USA,
- Congrats @SpaceX on landing Falcon’s suborbital booster stage,
- Welcome to the club!
- suborbital,
- When I met Elon, he had five children and the oldest were these gorgeous little blond-haired twins that felt like they jumped up out of my imagination.
- The sheer amount of time that I spent at work was so extreme that any relationship was very difficult to maintain,
- SpaceX and Tesla were difficult individually. Doing them both at the same time was almost impossible. So it was just all work all the time.
- She would invite me for dinner, and Elon wouldn’t show because he’s working late,
- She loved him to bits, but she understandably got tired of being treated that way.
- I felt this was not the life I should be living,
- I hated Los Angeles and I was terribly homesick for England.
- I saw Elon there, standing in front of the judge, and he sort of asked, ‘What the hell are we doing,’ and then we started kissing,
- I think the judge thought we were crazy.
- They’ve been wondering where you are.
- You’ve never heard that term?
- It means that people become king, and then they go crazy.
- I went full strength at him to try a judo throw, because I thought he was trying to take it easy on me,
- I decided to see if I could throw this guy, and I did. But I also blew out a disc at the base of my neck.
- So the same thing happened again, and I wanted to go back home,
- You’re my Mr. Rochester,
- And if Thornfield Hall burns down and you are blind, I’ll come to you and take care of you.
- Computing Machinery and Intelligence,
- imitation game
- think.
- Elon and I hit it off right away, and I went to visit him at his rocket factory,
- specist,
- Well, yes, I am pro-human,
- I fucking like humanity, dude.
- The future of AI should not be controlled by Larry,
- safety council,
- Elon’s takeaway was the council was basically bullshit,
- These Google guys have no intention of focusing on AI safety or doing anything that would limit their power.
- Our biggest existential threat,
- is probably artificial intelligence.
- I don’t love the idea of being a house cat,
- The danger comes when artificial intelligence is decoupled from human will.
- Obama got it,
- But I realized that it was not going to rise to the level of something that he would do anything about.
- It was funny how some of the engineers would scatter or look away when they saw Elon coming,
- They were afraid of him. But I was impressed by how much detail he understood about every little piece of the rocket.
- We wanted to have something like a Linux version of AI that was not controlled by any one person or corporation,
- The goal was to increase the probability that AI would develop in a safe way that would be beneficial to humanity.
- I think the best defense against the misuse of AI is to empower as many people as possible to have AI,
- AI alignment.
- Probably Tesla will have more real-world data than any other company in the world,
- Larry felt betrayed and was really mad at me for personally recruiting Ilya, and he refused to hang out with me anymore,
- And I was like, ‘Larry, if you just hadn’t been so cavalier about AI safety then it wouldn’t really be necessary to have some countervailing force.’ 
- We realized that Tesla was going to become an AI company and would be competing for the same talent as OpenAI,
- It pissed some of our team off, but I fully understood what was happening.
- Robotaxi
- light detection and ranging.
- The problem with Google’s approach is that the sensor system is too expensive,
- It’s better to have an optical system, basically cameras with software that is able to figure out what’s going on just by looking at things.
- Back then we had radar hardware in the car, and we told Elon that it was best safety-wise to use it,
- He agreed to let us keep radar in, but it was clear that he thought we should eventually be able to rely on camera vision only.
- Every meeting started with Elon saying, ‘Why can’t the car drive itself from my home to work?’ 
- Do something to program this right,
- There was just such a gulf between Elon’s goal and the possible,
- He just wasn’t aware enough of the challenges.
- We’re trying to have those conversations with Elon to establish what the sensors would need to do,
- And they were really difficult conversations, because he kept coming back to the fact that people have just two eyes and they can drive the car. But those eyes are attached to a neck, and the neck can move, and people can position those eyes all over the place.
- Together, this system provides a view of the world that a driver alone cannot access, seeing in every direction simultaneously and on wavelengths that go far beyond the human senses,
- pushing the envelope in terms of safety,
- Neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied,
- the driver neglected to maintain complete control of the Tesla leading up to the crash.
- then you are killing people.
- Next question.
- Full Self-Driving,
- without the need for a single touch
- When you want your car to return, tap Summon on your phone,
- It will eventually find you even if you are on the other side of the country.
- Robotaxis
- He was convinced that by the time we got Model Y into production it would be a full-on Robotaxi, fully autonomous,
- When will someone be able to buy one of your cars and literally just take the hands off the wheel and go to sleep and wake up and find that they’ve arrived?
- That’s about two years,
- on track to do it next year.
- I think we will be feature complete, Full Self-Driving, this year,
- I would say I am certain of that. That is not a question mark.
- If he lets up and admits that it’s going to take a long time,
- then nobody will rally around it and we won’t design vehicles that require autonomy.
- Ultimately, what it comes down to,
- is that to solve Full Self-Driving, you actually have to solve real-world artificial intelligence.
- I want to start a new business,
- One that can help humanity and address climate change.
- Get into the solar industry,
- my marching orders.
- Elon provided most of the initial funding,
- He gave us one clear piece of guidance: get to a scale that would have an impact as fast as possible.
- Risk is a type of fuel.
- We realized that the consumer experience was horrible and the high upfront cost was a massive barrier,
- Their sales tactics became like those schemes that go door to door selling you boxes of knives or something crappy like that,
- Are you a sales company or a product company?
- We would be kicking ass on market share,
- and Elon would be questioning aesthetic things and pointing out something like the look of the clips and get angry and say they were ugly.
- Tesla is not just an automotive company,
- It’s an energy innovation company.
- no-brainer
- legally and morally correct.
- master plan
- The overarching purpose of Tesla Motors is to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy.
- Elon made us realize that you’ve got to have solar and battery combined,
- We really wanted to offer an integrated product, but it was difficult when the engineers were at two different companies.
- disinterested
- Elon caused Tesla’s servile Board to approve the acquisition of an insolvent SolarCity at a patently unfair price, in order to bail out his (and other family members’) foundering investment,
- The acquisition marked a vital step forward for a company that had for years made clear to the market and its stockholders that it intended to expand from an electric car manufacturer to an alternative energy company.
- This is shit
- What if we can offer you a roof that looks way better than a normal roof? That lasts far longer than a normal roof? Different ballgame.
- solar roof
- But as often happened,
- Elon showed up late and then sat in the car looking at his phone while we all just waited very nervously for him to get out.
- This is shit,
- Total fucking shit. Horrible. What were you thinking?
- What part of ‘I fucking hate this product’ don’t you understand?
- I don’t think this guy should be on the team.
- Save us, Elon!
- The houses you see around you are all solar houses,
- Did you notice?
- This is the integrated future,
- We can solve the whole energy equation.
- Did you ever notice that cities are built in 3-D, but the roads are only built in 2-D?
- You could build roads in 3-D by building tunnels under cities,
- Okay,
- I will call you back in three hours.
- How much do these machines cost?
- Traffic is driving me nuts,
- Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging.
- It shall be called ‘The Boring Company.’ Boring, it’s what we do.
- Get started today,
- I want as big of a hole as we can by Sunday.
- He spent a lot of time giving us lessons about the importance of deleting steps and simplifying,
- The gopher in my yard doesn’t do that,
- Let’s go as fast as we can!
- the probability of longitudinal impact is extremely low.
- This is crazy,
- This is going to change everything.
- He doesn’t seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States,
- I thought that maybe some of the crazier stuff he said during the campaign was just a performance and he would land in a more sensible place,
- really wanted to get NASA going again.
- to get NASA going again.
- He seems kind of nuts,
- but he may turn out okay.
- He likes rockets, and he does good at rockets, too, by the way,
- I never saw where the engines come down with no wings, no anything, and they’re landing, and I said, ‘I’ve never seen that before,’ and I was worried about him, because he’s one of our great geniuses, and we have to protect our genius, you know we have to protect Thomas Edison and we have to protect all of these people that came up with originally the light bulb and the wheel and all of these things.
- Trump might be one of the world’s best bullshitters ever,
- Like my dad. Bullshitting can sometimes baffle the brain. If you just think of Trump as sort of a con-man performance, then his behavior sort of makes sense.
- It was brutal,
- I guess I could be called a geek for someone who can also be called a hot chick,
- She was just so toxic,
- A nightmare.
- She was like the Joker in Batman,
- She didn’t have a goal or aim other than chaos. She thrives on destabilizing everything.
- She really is a very good actress, so she will say things that you’re like, ‘Wow, maybe she’s telling you the truth,’ but she isn’t,
- The way she can create her own reality reminds me of my dad.
- I love him very much,
- Elon loves fire,
- and sometimes it burns him.
- It’s really sad that he falls in love with these people who are really mean to him,
- They’re beautiful, no question, but they have a very dark side and Elon knows that they’re toxic.
- Because I’m just a fool for love,
- I am often a fool, but especially for love.
- Elon put his hand on my leg and said, ‘please stay,’ 
- It was the only time I had ever seen Elon’s hands shaking.
- Elon and Kimbal were totally shut down, silent,
- We were lonely, lost people,
- One thing led to another—you can call it God’s plan or nature’s plan.
- I was actually slowly making amends with my father,
- but then he had a child with Jana and I said, ‘You’re done, you’re out. I never want to speak to you again.’ And I haven’t spoken to him since.
- I just broke up with my girlfriend. I was really in love, and it hurt bad.
- He was such a terrible human being,
- My dad will have a carefully thought-out plan of evil. He will plan evil. Almost every crime you can possibly think of, he has done. Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done.
- There is clearly something Musk wants to share, but he can’t bring himself to utter the words.
- That was the time of most concentrated pain I’ve ever had,
- Eighteen months of unrelenting insanity. It was mind-bogglingly painful.
- Hey, pal,
- We’ve got an earnings call to do.
- I can’t do it,
- You have to,
- He came from a comatose state to a place where we could actually get him in the chair, get other people in the room, get him through his opening statement, and then cover for him,
- I’ve got to lay down, I’ve got to shut off the lights. I just need some time alone.
- Yeah,
- Bad feelings correlate to bad events, so maybe the real problem is getting carried away for what I sign up for.
- Look, I have a relative who is bipolar,
- I’ve had close experience with this. If you get good treatment and your meds dialed right, you can get back to who you are. The world needs you.
- is just take the pain and make sure you really care about what you’re doing.
- Welcome to production hell!
- I’ve been in severe emotional pain for the last few weeks,
- Severe. It took every ounce of will to be able to do the Model 3 event and not look like the most depressed guy around.
- Sorry for being a little dry,
- Got a lot on my mind right now.
- The whole point of this company was to make a really great, affordable electric car,
- and we finally have.
- The major challenge for us over the next six to nine months is how do we build a huge number of cars,
- Frankly we’re going to be in production hell.
- Welcome! Welcome! Welcome to production hell! That’s where we are going to be for at least six months.
- I look forward to working alongside you journeying through hell,
- As the saying goes, if you’re going through hell, just keep going.
- If you’re right, Tesla is dead,
- We either have five thousand cars a week or we can’t cover our costs.
- It was a frenzy of insanity,
- We were getting four or five hours’ sleep, often on the floor. I remember thinking, ‘I’m like on the ragged edge of sanity.’ 
- I got a call from Elon saying be at the Van Nuys airstrip in an hour,
- We flew to Reno and I ended up staying there four months.
- There were a billion problems,
- A third of the cells were fucked up, and a third of the workstations were fucked up.
- When we got too exhausted, we’d go crash at the motel for four hours, then head back,
- I realized that the first error was trying to automate the process, which was my fault because I pushed for a lot of automation,
- What the hell are these strips for?
- It was like being in a Dilbert cartoon,
- See if you can tell the difference,
- Step one should be to question the requirements,
- Make them less wrong and dumb, because all requirements are somewhat wrong and dumb. And then delete, delete, delete.
- Who specified that requirement?
- So delete them,
- Hey, this doesn’t line up. Did you do this?
- Did you fucking do this?
- You’re an idiot,
- Get the hell out and don’t come back.
- My manager was fired a week after me, and his manager the week after that,
- At least Elon knew their names.
- When Elon gets upset, he lashes out, often at junior people,
- Gage’s story was fairly typical of his behavior where he just couldn’t really process his frustration in a productive way.
- In retrospect it may seem like great war stories,
- but in the middle of it, it was absolutely horrific. He was making us fire people who had been personal friends for a very long time, which was super painful.
- By trying to be nice to the people,
- you’re actually not being nice to the dozens of other people who are doing their jobs well and will get hurt if I don’t fix the problem spots.
- alien dreadnought
- We had this enormously automated production line that used tons of robots,
- There was one problem. It didn’t work.
- We began sawing robots out of the production line and throwing them into the parking lot,
- We put a hole in the side of the building just to remove all that equipment,
- They are leeches on the neck of business.
- They had up-to-date data from sources in the company and drones that flew over our factory giving them numbers in real time,
- They organized themselves into a shorty ground force and a shorty air force. The degree of inside information they had was insane.
- We think the deception is about to catch up to TSLA,
- Elon Musk’s erratic behavior suggests that he sees it the same way.
- Mr. Musk will be paid only if he reaches a series of jaw-dropping milestones based on the company’s market value and operations,
- Otherwise, he will be paid nothing.
- if Mr. Musk were somehow to increase the value of Tesla to $650 billion—a figure many experts would contend is laughably impossible.
- walk to the red.
- Elon was going completely apeshit, marching from station to station,
- At least twenty percent are going to be wrong, and we’re going to alter them later,
- But if I don’t make decisions, we die.
- Why are there six here?
- To make it stable in a crash,
- No, the main crash load would come through this rail,
- Even I could do it faster,
- Okay,
- I’m just going to just stand here until we find someone who can bring up that console.
- Factory settings are always idiotic,
- Why are we applying these?
- What the hell are these for?
- They’re slowing the whole damn line.
- That’s insane,
- Once in ten years there will be such a flood. When it happens, the floor mats can get wet.
- Unless a sensor is absolutely needed to start an engine or safely stop an engine before it explodes, it must be deleted,
- Going forward, anyone who puts a sensor (or anything) on the engine that isn’t obviously critical will be asked to leave.
- pressured to take shortcuts to hit aggressive Model 3 production goals.
- It’s a constant ‘How many cars have we built so far?’—a constant pressure to build,
- You have seventy-two hours to remove every unnecessary machine,
- Go or stay?
- go,
- Soon he was laughing, like with childlike humor,
- Excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake,
- To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated.
- The shorts thought they had perfect information,
- and they were all gloating online that, ‘Hah, Tesla is screwed.’ 
- a temporary vehicle repair facility.
- Get one of those permits and start building a huge tent,
- We’ll have to pay a fine later.
- So we put it on a slight slope, and gravity meant it had enough power to move the cars at the right speed,
- If conventional thinking makes your mission impossible,
- then unconventional thinking is necessary.
- Enjoy year 48 in the simulation!
- 5000th.
- We did it!!… Created entirely new solutions that were thought impossible. Intense in tents. Whatever. It worked…. I think we just became a real car company.
- the algorithm.
- I became a broken record on the algorithm,
- But I think it’s helpful to say it to an annoying degree.
- the legal department
- the safety department.
- Sorry, dude, I know you want to be with your wife, but you have to come back right away,
- Elon is having a meltdown.
- It was another example of him being a drama magnet,
- Hi sir, if possible can you assist in any way to get the twelve Thailand boys and their coach out of the cave?
- I suspect that the Thai govt has this under control, but I’m happy to help if there is a way to do so,
- I have one of the world’s best engineering teams who usually design spaceships and spacesuits working on this thing 24 hours a day,
- If it isn’t needed or won’t help, that would be great to know.
- It is absolutely worth continuing.
- just a PR stunt
- had absolutely no chance of working.
- he can stick his submarine where it hurts.
- Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.
- Bet ya a signed dollar it’s true.
- I’m not happy about the suggested approach…. We need to stop panicking.
- My words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths & suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness & according to specifications from the dive team leader…. Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth.
- You don’t think it’s strange he hasn’t sued me? He was offered free legal services.
- Yo Elon, don’t feed into the drama bro thats what they want.
- off the record.
- I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what’s actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you fucking asshole,
- He’s an old, single white guy from England who’s been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years, mostly Pattaya Beach, until moving to Chiang Rai for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time. There’s only one reason people go to Pattaya Beach. It isn’t where you’d go for caves, but it is where you’d go for something else. Chiang Rai is renowned for child sex-trafficking.
- pedo guy
- He was kind of losing it,
- This stuff has got to stop,
- You’re doing major damage to the brand.
- I definitely think that 2018 tailspin was not just Tesla related,
- It was a result of him just being in awful grief around Amber.
- open-loop.
- Whenever our friends become open-loop, meaning that they don’t have iterative feedback and don’t seem to care about the outcomes, we take it upon ourselves to let each other know,
- Okay, open-loop warning.
- like to listen more
- reasonable
- It seemed like better karma at four-twenty than at four-nineteen,
- But I was not on weed, to be clear. Weed is not helpful for productivity. There’s a reason for the word ‘stoned.’ 
- Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.
- Was this text legit?
- 420
- funding secured
- in talks
- This is an extremely weak statement and does not reflect the conversation we had. You said you were definitely interested in taking Tesla private and had wanted to do so since 2016. You are throwing me under the bus.
- We will never speak again. Never.
- It takes two to tango,
- We haven’t received anything yet…. We cannot approve something that we don’t have sufficient information on.
- I’m sorry, but we cannot work together,
- Given the feedback I’ve received, it’s apparent that most of Tesla’s existing shareholders believe we are better off as a public company,
- This is classic, extreme bipolar behavior risk-taking,
- I’m talking about behavior that is obviously being examined by many psychiatrists who are saying classic risk-taking, this is not what a CEO should be doing.
- take private
- was so impulsive, potentially inaccurate, poorly worded and thought out, and with such potentially dire consequences for himself, Tesla and its shareholders, that the board now must ask a sensitive but vital question: What was Mr. Musk’s state of mind when he wrote it?
- SEC charges Tesla Founder & CEO Elon Musk with Fraud,
- Tesla stock tumbles.
- So that’s like having a gun to your child’s head. I was forced to concede to the SEC unlawfully. Those bastards.
- Elon’s.
- Elon Musk is just an impulsive kid with a terrible Twitter habit.
- Are you OK?
- He has to talk to us,
- What do you want to know?
- Were you on drugs when you sent that tweet?
- No,
- Elon, how are you doing?
- Are you OK?
- It’s not been great, actually,
- I’ve had friends come by who are really concerned.
- There were times when I didn’t leave the factory for three or four days—days when I didn’t go outside,
- This has really come at the expense of seeing my kids.
- But from a personal pain standpoint, the worst is yet to come.
- In all the conversations I’ve had with business leaders over the years, not until Elon Musk got on the phone had an executive revealed such vulnerability.
- Elon Musk Details ‘Excruciating’ Personal Toll of Tesla Turmoil,
- Mr. Musk alternated between laughter and tears,
- He said he had been working up to 120 hours a week recently… [and] not taken more than a week off since 2001, when he was bedridden with malaria.
- Erratic NYT Interview Raises Alarm about Tesla Chief’s Health,
- We just need to kill this nonsense speculation around your mental state,
- options that present you at length—leading the companies, in charge, droll and self-aware.
- In no universe is it OK for you to continue to contemplate the sexual predilections of a Thai diver who insulted you.
- marijuana inside of tobacco
- You probably can’t because of stockholders, right?
- I mean, it’s legal right?
- Totally legal,
- You getting text messages from chicks?
- I’m getting text messages from friends saying, ‘What the hell are you doing smoking weed?’ 
- Tesla Inc.’s share price sank to near its lowest point for the year Friday after the electric-car maker lost more executives and Chief Executive Elon Musk appeared to smoke marijuana during an interview streamed on the web,
- SpaceX was a NASA contractor, and they are big believers in the law,
- So I had to be subjected to random drug tests for a couple of years. Fortunately, I really don’t like doing illegal drugs.
- Boring Company
- What’s next?
- Oh my God, let’s do it,
- Take home the flamethrower.
- not a flamethrower
- Open Butthole
- When you wish upon a falling star, your dreams can come true,
- Unless it’s really a meteor hurtling to the Earth which will destroy all life. Then you’re pretty much hosed, no matter what you wish for. Unless it’s death by meteorite.
- DON’T PANIC!
- So I called Elon and I said, ‘Look, I need you to help fund my business.’ 
- I remember,
- writing down in my journal, ‘unconditional love for Elon.’ 
- The money Elon was putting into it was getting poured down the drain,
- I had my finance guy look at it, and the restaurants are struggling. I think they should die.
- What did you just say?
- Fuck you. Fuck you! This is not how it works.
- If you would’ve looked at Tesla finance, it should have died as well,
- So this is not how this works.
- I basically strong-armed him into putting in five million,
- I was absolutely furious with Elon and didn’t speak to him,
- I felt like I lost my brother. That experience at Tesla had taken him to a place where he lost his mind. At that point I was like, ‘I’m done with you.’ 
- I decided to go back to being Elon’s brother because I didn’t want to lose him,
- I missed my brother.
- He responded as if nothing had happened,
- That’s how Elon is.
- It was becoming absolutely exhausting for me,
- I love you, but I can’t do this anymore.
- My percent happiness level was low and trending downward,
- He was struggling, and that made him more mercurial than even the normal,
- I felt terrible for him and tried to help him as a friend, but couldn’t really.
- phoning in rich,
- I was a little surprised at Elon’s reluctance to have me leave,
- He can flip, usually without warning, between being quite emotional and human to being literally zero percent of that,
- Sometimes he can feel extremely loving and caring, shockingly so, and you’re like, ‘Oh my gosh, yeah, we’ve been through incredible hardship together and have this deep bond and I love you, man.’ But then it becomes mixed with that blank stare, where it feels like he’s seeing straight through you and not registering any emotion at all.
- I’ve got a bad feeling about this,
- I don’t think we should do it today.
- It’s been a hell of a year,
- Ten years ago, nobody would’ve believed that could happen,
- fart app
- It’s like perhaps my finest piece of work,
- We expect to be feature complete with autonomy by the end of this year,
- It should be able to go from your home garage to your parking space at work without intervention.
- Yeah, I’m sometimes a little too optimistic about time frames,
- It’s time you knew that, yeah. But would I be doing this if I wasn’t optimistic? Geez.
- Drew joined my team when it was a tiny, tiny team of five or ten of us a couple years after the company got started, and he’s been my right-hand person involved in almost every key initiative that I’ve done at the company.
- I trace Tesla back to 2003, with JB and me having lunch with Harold Rosen,
- Yeah, that was a good conversation.
- We didn’t exactly envision how this would unfold,
- I believed we for sure would fail,
- Back in 2003, people thought electric cars were the stupidest thing ever, bad in every way, something like a golf cart.
- But it needed to be done,
- Flesh without Blood.
- Remember that elevator meeting?
- I mean that was super weird.
- Of all the times to meet,
- You were staring at me very intensely.
- No,
- you were the one giving me a weird stare.
- We just walked the floor all night, and I watched him try to fix things,
- I was like, oh shit, this guy is fucking crazy,
- The car was signaling and changing lanes by itself. It felt like a scene out of a Marvel movie.
- EM+CB
- That mattered to me,
- The only way I could be in a serious relationship is if the person I’m dating can also listen to an hour of, like, war history before bed,
- Elon and I have gone through so many topics, like ancient Greece and Napoleon and the military strategies of World War One.
- Man, you seem like you’re in a really rough headspace,
- Do you want me to bring my music stuff over and I can work at your house?
- But the storm just sort of never stopped, and then you’re just on the ship and on the ride, and I just stayed there.
- He’s always looking out for what’s wrong with the motor, what’s wrong with the engine, the heat shield, the liquid oxygen valve,
- I realized that even when I was with him, there would be times when his mind would go somewhere else, usually to an issue at work,
- take private
- I waited around all weekend while grimes coddled her boyfriend for being too stupid to know not to go on twitter while on acid,
- I saw him in the kitchen tucking his tail in between his legs scrounging for investors to cover his ass after that tweet,
- He was stressed and red in the face.
- 100% Tragedy,
- having to defeat Azealia Banks when she tried to destroy my life.
- My Dungeons and Dragons alignment would be chaotic good,
- whereas Amber’s is probably chaotic evil.
- He’s attracted to chaotic evil. It’s about his father and what he grew up with, and he’s quick to fall back into being treated badly. He associates love with being mean or abusive. There’s an Errol-Amber through line.
- The studio guys were like sweating,
- I told them that I was armed but not dangerous.
- It hit close to home,
- Asperger’s makes you a very difficult person,
- He’s not good at reading the room. His emotional comprehension is just very different from the average human.
- If someone has depression or anxiety, we sympathize. But if they have Asperger’s we say he’s an asshole.
- He has numerous minds and many fairly distinct personalities,
- He moves between them at a very rapid pace. You just feel the air in the room change, and suddenly the whole situation is just transferred over to his other state.
- My favorite version of E is the one who’s down for Burning Man and will sleep on a couch, eat canned soup, and be chill.
- Demon mode is when he goes dark and retreats inside the storm in his brain.
- When we hang out, I make sure I’m with the right Elon,
- There are guys in that head who don’t like me, and I don’t like them.
- You will say stuff to him and then he’ll just have no memory of it whatsoever, because he was in a brain space,
- If he’s focused on a particular thing, he will not get stimulation, not consume any inputs from the outside world. Stuff can be right in front of his eyes and he won’t see it.
- Everything doesn’t need to suck,
- You don’t need to feel stoked about everything all the time.
- Demon mode causes a lot of chaos,
- but it also gets shit done.
- How do I fix Tesla’s business in China?
- I’m going to China next week to meet the vice premier,
- Can you come with me?
- Tesla is too young,
- Like, we are barely a baby. Now you want to marry?
- Will you join Tesla?
- We kept explaining why it would help China to have Tesla build an auto factory, even if it wasn’t a joint venture,
- Do you believe this is the right thing?
- Okay, let’s do it,
- It was too curved,
- It didn’t have the authority of a pickup truck.
- We realized,
- that pickup trucks basically haven’t changed in their form or their manufacturing process in eighty years.
- Originally we were thinking aluminum,
- We also kicked around titanium, because durability was really important.
- We are going to do this whole thing in stainless steel.
- cold rolled
- Let’s make the strength on the outside, make it an exoskeleton, and hang everything else from the inside of it,
- Don’t resist me
- take private
- Let’s be bold,
- Let’s surprise people.
- Why doesn’t the future look like the future?
- I want the future to look like the future.
- I don’t care if no one buys it,
- We’re not doing a traditional boring truck. We can always do that later. I want to build something that’s cool. Like, don’t resist me.
- That’s it!
- I love it. We are doing that. Yes, this is what we are going to do! Yes, okay, done.
- A majority of people in this studio hated it,
- They were like, ‘You can’t be serious.’ They didn’t want to have anything to do with it. It was just too weird.
- If you don’t have buy-in from the people around you, it’s hard to get things done,
- I don’t do focus groups.
- We won’t be able to have one that we can actually drive by then,
- Yes, we will.
- It forced the team to come together, work twenty-four-seven, and rally around that date,
- Many in the crowd clearly couldn’t believe that this was actually the vehicle they’d come to see,
- The Cybertruck looks like a large metal trapezoid on wheels, more like an art piece than a truck.
- armor glass
- Oh my fucking God!
- Well, maybe that was a little too hard.
- Trucks have been the same for a very long time, like for a hundred years,
- We want to try something different.
- No Left Turn
- Mars Colonizer.
- We tried to avoid ever skipping Mars Colonizer, because that was the most fun meeting for him and always put him in a good mood,
- Internet revenue is about one trillion dollars a year,
- If we can serve three percent, that’s $30 billion, which is more than NASA’s budget. That was the inspiration for Starlink, to fund getting to Mars.
- The lens of getting to Mars has motivated every SpaceX decision.
- you know
- like
- wow, dude.
- I really, like, fell in love with it, you know, and felt, like, wow, man, this is what I was built to do,
- It was like, you know, do you want a free lunch on this rich guy?
- Hell yeah, I’m into that for sure.
- Man, this guy is crazy as hell, and I think he’s going to lose all his money, but he seems super smart and motivated and I like his style.
- I told the dude that we didn’t have time to paper our work orders and quality checks, we were just going to build it and test it at the very end,
- The quality dude was pretty mad, rightly, so we ended up in Elon’s cubicle arguing it out.
- It was pretty edgy, but he and I were hell-bent on getting this capsule done because we risked running out of money,
- We had marathon meetings, and Elon pushed on every little thing,
- By the time that I asked ‘Why?’ five times,
- people were like, ‘Shit, maybe we should just make this one integrated component.’ 
- I was, like, pretty happy with it,
- I’m sitting there thinking how clever I had been.
- Why not release them all at once?
- Life got way easier because we culled those parts,
- I was too chicken to propose that, but Elon made us try it.
- Sending this tweet through space via Starlink satellite,
- I could have made a lot of money, but I could not have made life multiplanetary,
- Renaming BFR to Starship.
- Stainless steel and I should go get a room somewhere,
- If we keep going with carbon fiber, we’re doomed,
- This extrapolates to death. I’ll never be able to get to Mars.
- Guys, we’ve got to change course,
- We are never going to build rockets fast enough with this process. What about going with stainless steel?
- Run the numbers,
- Run the numbers.
- With stainless steel, you can smoke a cigar next to it as you weld it,
- One of Elon’s rules is ‘Go as close to the source as possible for information,’ 
- What about four?
- That would make us pretty nervous,
- Okay,
- let’s do four millimeters. Let’s give it a try.
- Once I gave Elon the context, he agreed we couldn’t do what he wanted,
- high bays
- You need to come down to Boca Chica and do whatever you can to make this place great,
- The future of humanity’s progress in space depends on it.
- Can’t get to Mars if the bugs eat us first,
- We are going to make a dome by dawn if it fucking kills us,
- We didn’t actually have a dome by dawn,
- It took us until about nine a.m.
- We have to raise money or we’re fucked,
- Every couple hours I would wake up, and he was just still sitting there, in the thinking man statue pose, just completely silent on the edge of the bed,
- I solved it.
- This is where the world is going,
- Let’s push ourselves there.
- We have to show people this is real,
- He had to divorce himself from reality in order to get out of a shitty situation when he thought disaster was imminent,
- He once asked me to tell him if he’d ever gone bananas. This was the only time I’ve ever walked in the room, looked at him, and said the word ‘bananas.’ This was the first time he saw me cry.
- I saw it was from Elon, and thought, ‘Oh, this is bad,’ 
- insanely difficult
- We did not believe we could do what he demanded, but he believed we could,
- In just weeks, we were able to make it do seven difficult turns.
- presented bold, visionary promises that only his most loyal followers would take at face value.
- We asked a lot of tough questions when we had an analysts call with him afterwards,
- He kept saying, ‘You guys just don’t get it.’ And then he hung up on us.
- Would you rather live in Tulsa or Austin?
- Okay, great. We’ll do it in Austin and you should run it.
- We’re building twice as fast as Shanghai per square foot, despite the regulations we face,
- How much bigger would we need to make this place to be able to say it’s the biggest building in the world?
- We won’t get there.
- Don’t we want it to be completely floor to ceiling?
- We can’t do things that are silly from a cost perspective,
- Can you have the coolant flow at a faster rate?
- I want to be clear,
- No more than fifty-nine seconds of cycling time, or I’m going to come here and cut it off personally.
- Why can’t we do that?
- Go figure out how to do it,
- Ask for a bigger casting machine. It’s not as if that would break the laws of physics.
- We did the world’s largest casting machine,
- It’s a six-thousand-ton one for the Model Y, and we will also use a nine-thousand-ton one for Cybertruck.
- So it went from a horrible nightmare to something that is crazy cheap and easy and fast,
- They have to produce things very quickly and cheaply without flaws, and manufacture them all by Christmas, or there will be sad faces.
- Precision is not expensive,
- It’s mostly about caring. Do you care to make it precise? Then you can make it precise.
- the unknown variable.
- ash,
- my elven spelling of Ai (love &/or Artificial intelligence).
- Fighting with information, not with weapons,
- The third name is always a battle because Elon wants to delete them because he thinks it’s too busy. I’d go to like five names but three’s a compromise.
- It was Elon’s Asperger’s coming out in full,
- He was just clueless about why I’d be upset.
- Saxon has a really interesting perception,
- because you can see him wrestling with abstract concepts, like time and the meaning of life. He thinks in very literal terms that slip you into a different way of perceiving the universe.
- They lived in the same house and the same room and had the same experiences and did similarly on tests,
- But Damian thought of himself as smart, and Kai didn’t, for some reason. So bizarre.
- To decrease my carbon footprint,
- I think Damian is brighter than you,
- He’s bigger and more athletic than Damian and is very protective of him,
- I hate you and everything you stand for.
- Hey, I’m transgender, and my name is now Jenna,
- Don’t tell my dad.
- When you put he/him in ur bio.
- I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare.
- When I was still with my ex-wife, Elon tried to convince us to have children,
- He has no biases about gay or trans or race.
- became intense when she went beyond socialism to being a full communist and thinking that anyone rich is evil.
- They went there until they were about fourteen, but then I thought they should be introduced to the real world for high school,
- What I should have done is extend Ad Astra through high school.
- I’ve made many overtures,
- but she doesn’t want to spend time with me.
- I am selling almost all physical possessions,
- Will own no house.
- I think possessions kind of weigh you down and they’re an attack vector,
- In recent years ‘billionaire’ has become pejorative, like that’s a bad thing. They’ll say, ‘Hey, billionaire, you’ve got all this stuff.’ Well, now I don’t have stuff, so what are you going to do?
- I stopped staying at Ken’s house after the Journal doxed me,
- People kept trying to come around, and someone managed to get through the gates and into the house when I wasn’t there.
- a cool house though not one that would be in Architectural Digest.
- An Ayahuasca ceremony involves an ego death,
- All of that baggage you have dies. You are a different human after that.
- I’ve just got emotions buried under so much layers of concrete, I’m just not ready to open that up,
- It hit home to both of us, because it has one super-empathetic person, played by Ralph Macchio, and the other person is the non-empathetic one,
- They’re both struggling with their own challenges with their father figure and also with how to be father figures to their own children.
- We were like two kids again,
- It was beautiful, the best time ever. We never thought we’d ever get one of those weeks again in our lives.
- I’m not a religious person,
- but I nonetheless got on my knees and prayed for that mission.
- This is the first big space message in fifty years, think of that,
- And it is an honor to be delivering it.
- Are you guys ready to do four more years?
- hugeness of the moment
- My brother has just sent astronauts up into space!
- We have 783 employees working at the Cape,
- Why are there only two of them working now?
- I will never forget walking the floor that day,
- All the young engineers working their asses off and wearing T-shirts and sporting tattoos and being really badass about getting things done. I thought, ‘These are my people.’ It was nothing like the buttoned-up deadly vibe at Boeing.
- If Boeing doesn’t change,
- you’re going to lose out on the top talent.
- Maybe we want the people who aren’t the best, but who will stick around longer.
- I can make things happen,
- Anyone who is brave enough to come up to me with a crumpled-up résumé might be a good candidate,
- I’m like super tired, half-drunk, haven’t slept in days, so I got in the car, bought a pack of cigarettes to get me going, and made it back to the hangar,
- I worried about getting pulled over for drunk driving, but that seemed less of a risk than ignoring Elon.
- skip-level
- It was all very subtle,
- That’s typical Elon. A decision to take a risk signaled by a nod of the head.
- The FAA is both incompetent and conservative, which is a bad mixture, but I still needed a sign-off from them before we should have flown, and we did not have that,
- Elon had launched when the FAA said we couldn’t. So I wrote a true report that said that.
- He didn’t see it that way, and got touchy, very touchy,
- You did an awesome job over many years, but eventually everybody’s time comes to retire,
- Yours is now.
- immensely complex
- high risk.
- has not produced a single rocket or spacecraft capable of reaching orbit.
- Can’t get it up (to orbit) lol,
- profit,
- P-r-o-p-h-e-t.
- Step by step, ferociously.
- reasonably good engineering aptitude,
- But he does not seem to be willing to spend mental energy getting into the details of engineering. The devil’s in the details.
- In some ways, I’m trying to goad him into spending more time at Blue Origin so they make more progress,
- He should spend more time at Blue Origin and less time in the hot tub.
- I certainly never thought of this as a metric,
- It forced me to try some creative thinking about how we could improve efficiency.
- kisses
- Turns out Besos retired to pursue a full-time job filing lawsuits against SpaceX.
- Elon was so sweet to turn up with his new baby to our flight,
- Five Decades of Apollo
- He doesn’t seem to sleep much,
- space,
- I thought it was cool that they’re spending money on the advancement of space,
- To put things into perspective, you need about a hundred times more energy to get to orbit versus suborbit,
- And then, to get back from orbit you need to burn off that energy, so you need a heavy-duty heat shield. Orbit is roughly two orders of magnitude more difficult than suborbit.
- Give my regards to your puppet master.
- For now, Musk is well ahead in virtually every area,
- SpaceX has dispatched three teams of astronauts to the International Space Station and on Tuesday is scheduled to launch a crew of civilian astronauts on a three-day trip orbiting Earth. Blue Origin has launched a single suborbital mission to space that lasted just over 10 minutes.
- rocket,
- car,
- daddy.
- chopsticks.
- the holy grail for making humans a space-faring civilization.
- Why don’t we try to use the tower to catch it?
- If the booster comes back down to the tower and crashes into it, you can’t launch the next rocket for a long time,
- But we agreed to study different ways to do it.
- We have this tower, so why not try to use it?
- Harlow, you’re on board with this plan,
- So why don’t you be in charge of it?
- Mechazilla.
- We’re going to try to catch the booster with the launch tower arm!
- Legs would certainly work, but the best part is no part.
- Kick ass!
- The viewership on this one is going to be huge.
- SpaceX will try to catch largest ever flying object with robot chopsticks,
- Success is not guaranteed, but excitement is!
- We need to stack the ship on the booster,
- That will force the regulators to get off their butts,
- There will be public pressure getting them to move to approval.
- extrude shit out of the system,
- Why is no one working?
- What is the fucking problem?
- I want to see activity.
- This is not a volunteer organization,
- We are not selling Girl Scout cookies. Get them here now.
- Starship Surge
- Anyone who is not working on other obviously critical path projects at SpaceX should shift immediately to work on the first Starship orbit,
- Please fly, drive, or get here by any means possible.
- Ship+Rocket Stacked T –196h 44m 23s,
- We need to get to Mars before I die,
- There’s no forcing function for getting us to Mars other than us, and sometimes that means me.
- I feel renewed faith in the future of humanity,
- I want to be super clear,
- You are not the friend of the engineers. You are the judge. If you’re popular among the engineers, this is bad. If you don’t step on toes, I will fire you. Is that clear?
- idiot index.
- If the ratio is high, you’re an idiot.
- What are the best parts in Raptor as judged by the idiot index?
- I’m not sure,
- I will find out.
- You better be fucking sure in the future you know these things off the top of your head,
- If you ever come into a meeting and do not know what are the idiot parts, then your resignation will be accepted immediately.
- How can you fucking not know what the best and worst parts are?
- I know the cost chart down to the smallest part,
- I just don’t know the cost of the raw materials of those parts.
- What are the worst five parts?
- NO! Don’t look at your screen,
- Just name one. You should know the problematic parts.
- There’s the half nozzle jacket,
- I think it costs thirteen thousand dollars.
- It’s made of a single piece of steel,
- How much does that material cost?
- I think a few thousand dollars?
- No. It’s just steel. It’s about two hundred bucks. You have very badly failed. If you don’t improve, your resignation will be accepted. This meeting is over. Done.
- We are looking at the twenty worst ‘idiot index’ parts,
- There’s definitely some themes.
- It’s mainly the parts that require a lot of high-precision machining, like pumps and fairings,
- We need to cut out as much of the machining as possible.
- We are looking at some of the techniques that automakers use to keep these costs down,
- We should ask each of them to see if they can get the cost of their part down by eighty percent,
- and if they can’t, we should consider asking them to step aside if someone else might be able to do so.
- I heard that Lucas lost his first child about seven weeks ago,
- He and his wife had a baby with birth problems who was never able to leave the hospital.
- I still need to tell Elon,
- I give people hardcore feedback, mostly accurate, and I try not to do it in a way that’s ad hominem,
- I try to criticize the action, not the person. We all make mistakes. What matters is whether a person has a good feedback loop, can seek criticism from others, and can improve. Physics does not care about hurt feelings. It cares about whether you got the rocket right.
- He kept coming back at me on the costs of the Raptor’s half nozzle jacket,
- He was correct about what the materials cost, and I couldn’t figure out a way in the moment to explain the other costs in a way that was successful.
- I was very detail oriented, very Type A, very dedicated and disciplined,
- I was a space nerd as a kid,
- When Elon was really chewing me out, I focused hard on trying to keep my composure,
- Gymnastics teaches you to stay calm in a high-pressure situation. I was just trying to hold it together and not collapse.
- idiot index
- That’s a good question,
- I have no idea. I don’t know if he internalizes those meetings or remembers them. All I know is that, afterwards, he at least knew my name.
- After talking with my wife, we are comfortable with you sharing the story.
- Gwynne definitely cares a lot about people, which I think at the company is an important role for her to fill,
- Elon cares a lot about humanity, but humanity in more of a very macro sense.
- He’s willing to just throw his entire being at his mission, and that’s what he expects in return,
- That has a good and bad side. You definitely realize that you’re a tool being used to achieve this larger objective, and that’s great. But sometimes, tools get worn down and he feels he can just replace that tool.
- Working for Elon is one of the most exciting things you can do, but it doesn’t allow time for a lot else in your life,
- Sometimes that’s a great trade. If Raptor becomes the most affordable engine ever created and gets us to Mars, then it may be worth the collateral damage. That’s what I believed for more than eight years. But now, especially after the death of our baby, it’s time for me to focus on other things in life.
- He wants to know you’ve listened,
- So I learned to repeat his feedback. If he says the walls should be yellow, I will say, ‘I hear you, this is not successful, we’re going to paint the walls yellow.’ 
- I actually thought Krebs was quite self-aware when he messed up,
- His feedback loop was good. I can work with people if they have a good critical feedback loop.
- He will report to me,
- Please give him your full support.
- I had to make sure all the workers stayed motivated,
- It’s like Machiavelli taught,
- You have to have fear and love for the leader. Both.
- I fucking hate my cousins,
- I don’t think I ever will ever speak to them again.
- Everybody was super scared of him,
- fucking failure.
- You have two weeks to fix this. I fired my cousins and I’ll fire you if you don’t get installations going ten times faster.
- Don’t worry about sales tactics, which is a mistake my cousins made,
- Awesome products grow with word of mouth.
- Question every requirement.
- Delete.
- Simplify.
- accelerate.
- Instead of two nails for each foot, try it with only one,
- If the house has a hurricane, the whole neighborhood is fucked up, so who cares? One nail is going to be fine.
- Don’t worry about making it as waterproof as a submarine,
- My house in California used to leak. Somewhere between sieve and submarine should be okay.
- We need to get the engineers who designed this system to come out here and see how hard it is to install,
- I want to see the engineers out here installing it themselves. Not just doing it for five minutes. Up on roofs for days, for fucking days!
- How many roofs have you done?
- I’ve got twenty years of experience in the roof business,
- But how many solar roofs have you installed?
- Then you don’t fucking know what you’re fucking talking about,
- This is why your roofs are shit and take so long to install.
- If we fail,
- we will not get to a sustainable energy future.
- Not enough,
- We need to increase that tenfold.
- Solar roof meetings are like daggers in my eye.
- Nice work, guys,
- You should stopwatch each step. That will make it more fun, like a game.
- It’s not my favorite way to fix things, but it worked,
- The improvement from yesterday to today was gigantic. The big difference is that today the engineers were actually on the roof installing instead of at a keyboard.
- I’m a person who will literally sweep the floors if that’s going to help this company,
- The crew was crushing it using our new methods,
- They were finishing up the install after just one day.
- You’ve got to cut costs,
- You’ve got to show me a plan by next week to cut costs in half.
- Okay, let’s do it,
- We’ll kick ass and cut costs.
- Thank you for trying,
- But this isn’t cutting it.
- It was just the most bizarre, weird firing you could imagine,
- I had so much history with him, and deep down Elon knows that I have something special. He knows that I can kick ass, because we’d done it together in the past, in the Nevada battery factory. But he thought I was losing my edge, even though I had missed my birthday with my family to be up on that roof with him.
- To anyone I’ve offended, I just want to say, I reinvented electric cars and I’m sending people to Mars in a rocket ship. Did you think I was also going to be a chill, normal dude?
- I’m actually making history tonight as the first person with Asperger’s to host SNL—or at least the first to admit it,
- I won’t make a lot of eye contact with the cast tonight, but don’t worry, I’m pretty good at running ‘human’ in emulation mode.
- This isn’t funny.
- We made it more real and funnier,
- He is such a nerdy guy that he didn’t really know how to party as a kid,
- but now he’s really made up for it.
- in Texas you can do whatever you want.
- There are so many openings in the skin that it looks like Swiss cheese!
- The hole size for antennas should be tiny—just enough to fit a wire through. All loads or other design requirements must have an individual name assigned to them. No design by committee.
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Renegade Burn
- This is a religious experience for a loyal community,
- The Man Must Burn! And it did.
- I love you, but I don’t love you,
- Player of Games,
- I went to get him so he would come up front to greet people, but he wanted to stay longer watching the magician,
- I want anyone with any worries or any suggestions to send a note to me directly,
- There is a risk that we wanted to brief you on,
- We’re planning to fly higher than a typical Space Station mission and most other human space flight experiences.
- The risk is actually a big one involving orbital debris,
- We’re worried that penetration of the cabin by a piece of debris or damage to the heat shields could compromise the vehicle during reentry,
- There is significant uncertainty in the predicted risk.
- There are potential orbits in lower altitudes,
- including going down to one hundred ninety kilometers.
- Why aren’t we doing that?
- The customer wanted to go higher than the International Space Station,
- He really wanted to go for the highest he could. We briefed him on all this orbital debris stuff. He and his crew understand the risk and accept it.
- Okay, great,
- I think that’s fair, as long he’s fully informed.
- If we’re going to go to the moon again, and we’re going to go to Mars, we’ve got to get a little outside our comfort zone.
- chief spell master,
- I worried that I would get a little upset or emotional,
- I had been there longer than anyone else.
- It’s his last mission,
- I know,
- I was not offended by it,
- Musk cares a lot, but he’s not emotionally nurturing.
- Congratulations to @elonmusk and the @SpaceX team on their successful Inspiration4 launch last night,
- Another step towards a future where space is accessible to all of us.
- Thank you.
- We don’t want to do that,
- Why not?
- Gwynne said they’d pay a half-billion dollars.
- We will lose that in reputation,
- Yeah, it should not be something we do anytime soon.
- Maybe only after it becomes mundane to go into orbit.
- SpaceX and Elon are an amazing success story,
- There’s synergy between the public sector and the private sector, and it’s all to the good of mankind.
- Building mass-market electric cars was inevitable,
- It would have happened without me. But becoming a space-faring civilization is not inevitable.
- Technology does not automatically progress,
- This flight was a great example of how progress requires human agency.
- My neural net is getting fired up like it’s the Fourth of July,
- This is what I like doing most, iterating with kickass engineers!
- I cut it myself,
- I had someone else cut the back.
- When I see a tube that cost twenty thousand dollars, I want to stab my eye with a fork,
- What the fuck is going on?
- There is a shit ton of metal there that doesn’t make any damn sense.
- Enough said,
- You’re getting analysis paralysis. We are moving every part possible to low-cost steel.
- I’m convinced you could make a steel faceplate,
- Please do it. I think I’ve been pretty clear: make it out of steel.
- If you make this thing fast, you can find out fast. And then you can fix it fast.
- Any leaders emerging?
- My neural net for assessing engineering skill is good, but it’s hard to do when they’re wearing masks,
- anything with a lot of heavy engineering.
- I didn’t think he knew my name,
- Are you still up?
- Yeah, I’m still up, I’ll be in the office for at least a few more hours.
- Jake McKenzie is reporting to me directly going forward,
- remove most of the flanges and Inconel parts in favor of weldable steel alloys, as well as delete any part that is even *potentially* unnecessary. If we don’t end up adding back some parts later, we haven’t deleted enough.
- Okay, can you stop putting your face in your palm?
- Because it’s really, really like hurting my feelings.
- I created separate design and production groups a long time ago, and that was a bullshit mistake,
- You are responsible for the production process. You can’t hand it off to someone else. If the design is expensive to produce, you change the design.
- LEET.
- the fundamental breakthrough needed to make life multiplanetary.
- Our goal is the great adventure engine,
- Does it have a chance of success above zero? If so, put it in! If we find that there are changes we made that are too adventurous, then we will back up.
- There are a lot of ways to skin a cat,
- But it’s important to know what the post-skinned cat looks like. The answer is muscly and gnarly.
- We are not shooting for the moon,
- We are shooting for Mars. A maniacal sense of urgency is our operating principle.
- The SpaceX 1337 engine is the last major critical breakthrough needed to get humanity to Mars!!! No words are enough to capture how important this is for the future of civilization.
- It might result in poor fuel gas distribution, might not. Let’s find out.
- We are on a deletion *rampage*!!
- Nothing is sacred. Any remotely questionable tubes, sensors, manifolds, etc. will be deleted tonight. Please go ultra-hardcore on deletion and simplification.
- It doesn’t help contain much of the propellant,
- It’s like peeing in a swimming pool. Doesn’t affect the swimming pool much.
- I’m moving the SpaceX propulsion focus back to Raptor,
- We need engine production rate to be one per day to keep up a decent launch cadence. It is currently at one every three days.
- Yes,
- We can’t make life multiplanetary with Raptor, as it is way too expensive, but Raptor is needed to tide us over until 1337 is ready.
- The exercise helped define what an ideal engine looks like,
- But it was not moving the needle on stuff that was immediately needed to advance the Starship program.
- If you can create a self-driving car, which is a robot on wheels, then you can make a robot on legs as well,
- Humanoid robots are going to happen, like it or not,
- and we should do it so we can guide it in a good direction.
- This has the potential to be the far biggest thing we ever do, even bigger than a self-driving car,
- Once we hear a recurring theme from Elon, we start working on it,
- doesn’t feel like it could or would want to hurt you.
- AI Day,
- It’s draining to have to switch between so many issues,
- But there are a lot of problems, and I have to solve them.
- Because I’m worried about Larry Page,
- I had long conversations with him about AI dangers, but he didn’t get it. Now we barely speak.
- She will do acrobatics!
- Can we make her do cool stuff that looks impossible? Like tap dancing with a hat and cane?
- The kid has a real good power pack,
- He gets his software updates by walking around and looking and listening.
- Let’s make it go five miles per hour, not four, and give it power to lift a bit more weight,
- We overdid making it look gentle.
- Many a fool has gone down the swappable battery path, and it’s usually because they have a lousy battery,
- We went down that path with Tesla originally. No swappable pack. Just make the pack bigger so it can operate sixteen hours.
- If we’re able to produce a general-purpose robot that could observe you and learn how to do a task, that would supercharge the economy to a degree that’s insane,
- Then we may want to institute universal basic income. Working could become a choice.
- This is boring,
- There is too much here that is not cool. This is a recruiting event, and no one will want to join after seeing these fucking slides.
- Let’s look at your slides and see how we can fix this,
- I’m going to get through the event,
- I’m not going to let my team down.
- I sucked up my anger and brought the new slides to Elon,
- Yep, sure. Okay.
- human-computer interfaces.
- Man-Computer Symbiosis,
- get a computer and a person thinking together.
- The hope is that, in not too many years, human brains and computing machines will be coupled together very tightly.
- 1. Insert quarter 2. Avoid Klingons
- Imagine if you could think into the machine,
- like a high-speed connection directly between your mind and your machine.
- Can you get a neuroscientist who can help me understand computer-brain interface?
- Then you could have true human-machine symbiosis,
- neural lace
- When I first read Banks,
- it struck me that this idea had a chance of protecting us on the artificial intelligence front.
- If we can find good commercial uses to fund Neuralink,
- then in a few decades we will get to our ultimate goal of protecting us against evil AI by tightly coupling the human world to our digital machinery.
- How can I get this thing that’s in my head out as efficiently as possible?
- It would have to be something tiny put in my head.
- neural dust,
- Neuralink is not just about research,
- It’s about building real devices.
- I noticed that I learned more unique lessons from Elon per minute than any other human I’ve met,
- It would be dumb to not spend some of your life with such a person.
- an integrated brain-machine interface platform with thousands of channels.
- I could have a Neuralink right now and you wouldn’t know,
- Maybe I do.
- This has to be a single device,
- A single elegant package with no wires, no connections, no router.
- Delete,
- Delete, delete, delete.
- We thought this was impossible,
- but now we’re actually pretty stoked by it.
- Why does it have to be so small?
- We have a choice,
- We can shut down car production. We can make Phoenix work right away. Or we can remove radar entirely.
- We should be able to kick ass on this with a pure vision solution,
- Not requiring radar and vision to identify the same object is a mega game changer.
- I’m pulling the plug,
- Delete radar.
- If you won’t remove it,
- I will get someone else who will.
- Going forward, turn off radar,
- It’s a terrible crutch. I’m not kidding. And it’s clear that camera-only driving is working well.
- Unlike technologists at almost every other company working on self-driving vehicles, Mr. Musk insisted that autonomy could be achieved solely with cameras,
- But many Tesla engineers questioned whether it was safe enough to rely on cameras without the benefit of other sensing devices—and whether Mr. Musk was promising drivers too much about Autopilot’s capabilities.
- Improvements to common driver assistance systems is moving the industry toward more radar, and even more novel modalities like LiDAR and thermal imaging,
- Tesla, in a marked contrast, is moving backwards.
- the worst software ever sold by a Fortune 500 company.
- We went back and forth with the privacy team about that,
- We cannot associate the selfie streams to a specific vehicle, even when there’s a crash, or at least that’s the guidance from our lawyers.
- privacy teams
- I am the decision-maker at this company, not the privacy team,
- I don’t even know who they are. They are so private you never know who they are.
- Perhaps we can have a pop-up where we tell people that if they use FSD [Full Self-Driving], we will collect data in the event of a crash,
- Would that be okay?
- As long as we are communicating it to customers, I think we’re okay with that.
- Elon’s not against radar,
- he’s just against bad radar.
- You may be right,
- It’s a much more sophisticated radar than general automotive radar,
- It’s what you would see in a weapons system. It creates a picture of what’s going on rather than just getting a ping back.
- It’s worth experimenting. I’m always open to evidence from physics experiments.
- Let’s change the rigged tax code so the Person of the Year will actually pay taxes and stop freeloading off everyone else,
- If you opened your eyes for 2 seconds, you would realize I will pay more taxes than any American in history this year. Don’t spend it all at once… oh wait you did already.
- We were underneath this art piece with interactive lights dancing to beautiful music from Claire [Grimes],
- I thought about how our good fortune was thanks to Elon, but he just couldn’t let himself enjoy the moment.
- Any great docs you’d recommend?
- They don’t need to be famous or have fancy offices.
- I’m not super OK, tbh,
- I’ve been burning the candle at both ends with a flamethrower for a very long time. It has taken its toll. I was very ill this weekend.
- We needed to be with him because he gets lonely,
- He loves to have family around and we have to do that for him, you know, because he’s under so much stress.
- Last week was a good week,
- Technically, I did spend all night Friday and Saturday at the rocket factory working on Raptor issues, but still a good week. It is very painful, but we have to just muscle through building Raptor, even though it really needs a complete redesign.
- It’s been one of the most meaningful friendships of my life, like, by far,
- Soon after I met him I said, ‘I hope we’re friends for life.’ 
- In six years, Elon and I have never, never gotten in a fight, never argued.
- the motherhood bug super hard,
- People are going to have to revive the idea of having children as a kind of social duty,
- Otherwise civilization will just die.
- He really wants smart people to have kids, so he encouraged me to,
- If the choice is between an anonymous sperm donor or doing it with the person you admire most in the world, for me that was a pretty fucking easy decision,
- I can’t possibly think of genes I would prefer for my children.
- It seemed like something that would make him very happy.
- No,
- I was thrilled to be becoming a mother.
- I thought he would play a role like a godfather,
- because the dude’s got a lot going on.
- There’s some stuff he just can’t do because he’s emotionally hardwired a bit differently,
- But when he comes in, they light up and have eyes only for him, which lights him up as well.
- I really wanted him to have a daughter so bad,
- she’s all sparkly and a lot goofier troll,
- Elon always says we need to figure out what the question is before we can know the answers to the universe,
- Few individuals have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too,
- Musk is staking a claim to be the most genuinely innovative entrepreneur of his generation.
- I’m just trying to get people to Mars, and enable freedom of information with Starlink, accelerate sustainable technology with Tesla, and free people from the drudgery of driving,
- It’s certainly possible that the road to hell to some degree is paved with good intentions—but the road to hell is mostly paved with bad intentions.
- Take the red pill
- The coronavirus panic is dumb,
- I’d like to be super clear that if you feel the slightest bit ill or even uncomfortable, please do not feel obligated to come to work,
- I will personally be at work. My frank opinion remains that the harm from the coronavirus panic far exceeds that of the virus itself.
- If somebody wants to stay in their house, that’s great,
- But to say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist. This is not democratic. This is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom.
- I will be on the line with everyone else,
- If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.
- Take the red pill.
- Take the red pill
- Taken!
- traceroute woke_mind_virus
- Traceroute
- Unless the woke-mind virus, which is fundamentally antiscience, antimerit, and antihuman in general, is stopped, civilization will never become multiplanetary.
- He feels he lost a son who changed first and last names and won’t speak to him anymore because of this woke-mind virus,
- He is a firsthand witness on a very personal level of the damaging effect of being indoctrinated by this woke-mind religion.
- Wokeness wants to make comedy illegal, which is not cool,
- Trying to shut down David Chappelle, come on, man, that’s crazy. Do we want a humorless society that is simply rife with condemnation and hate and no forgiveness? At its heart wokeness is divisive, exclusionary, and hateful. It gives mean people a shield to be mean and cruel, armed with false virtue.
- an activist, woke, far-left Democrat.
- In the past I voted Democrat, because they were (mostly) the kindness party,
- But they have become the party of division & hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican. Now, watch their dirty tricks campaign against me unfold.
- The attacks against me should be viewed through a political lens—this is their standard (despicable) playbook—but nothing will deter me from fighting for a good future and your right to free speech.
- Finally, we get to use Elongate as scandal name. It’s kinda perfect,
- Hi Chad… Fine, if you touch my wiener, you can have a horse.
- This woke-mind virus resides primarily in the Democratic Party, even though most Dems don’t agree with it,
- Elizabeth Warren actually called me a freeloading grifter who doesn’t pay taxes, when I’m literally paying the most tax of any individual in history,
- F*ck Elon Musk,
- I came there when it was the land of opportunity,
- Now it’s the land of litigation, regulation, and taxation.
- When he was vice president, I went to a lunch with him in San Francisco where he droned on for an hour and was boring as hell, like one of those dolls where you pull the string and it just says the same mindless phrases over and over.
- Well, these are the three largest employers of the United Auto Workers,
- so I’ll let you draw your own conclusions.
- Detroit’s leading the world in electric vehicles,
- Mary, I can remember talking to you way back in January about the need for America to lead in electric vehicles. You changed the whole story, Mary. You electrified the entire automobile industry. I’m serious. You led, and it matters.
- Biden is a damp sock puppet in human form,
- Biden would do best to stick to the facts and acknowledge—as the market has—Tesla’s role as the leader in the EV revolution.
- Companies have announced investments totaling more than $200 billion in domestic manufacturing here in America—from iconic companies like GM and Ford building out new electric vehicle production to Tesla, our nation’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer.
- super bad feeling
- So, you know, lots of luck on his trip to the moon.
- Thanks Mr. President!
- I want you to know that our charging mechanisms both in the car and our stations are going to be interoperable,
- Elon Musk will open a big part of Tesla’s network up to all drivers,
- That’s a big deal, and it’ll make a big difference.
- Thank you. Tesla is happy to support other EVs via our Supercharger network.
- the debilitating impact that politically-correct ‘multiculturalism’ has had upon higher education and academic freedom.
- The so-called war against wokeism is one of the dumbest things ever,
- Is this from 4chan or something? You’re actually starting to sound like someone from the far right.
- I’m thinking of creating a ‘Super Moderate Super PAC’ that supports candidates with centrist views from all parties,
- To be clear, I support the left half of the Republican Party and the right half of the Democratic Party!
- I am just wired for war, basically,
- I just fell down a fucking rabbit hole, and there’s so many life lessons you learn, so many weird things about yourself and your opponents,
- He just absolutely crushed me both games,
- He doesn’t have hobbies or ways to relax other than video games,
- but he takes those so seriously that it gets very intense.
- It was one of our biggest fights ever,
- He took it as this deep betrayal moment.
- It’s a huge fucking deal,
- Yeah, I was wrong,
- But it’s the best game ever.
- Come on, you got to come hang out,
- He said it would teach me how to be a CEO like he was,
- We called them Polytopia Life Lessons.
- He knows that I have an empathy gene, unlike him, and it has hurt me in business,
- Polytopia taught me how he thinks when you remove empathy. When you’re playing a video game, there is no empathy, right?
- I have this feeling,
- that as a kid you were playing one of these strategy games and your mom unplugged it, and you just didn’t notice, and you kept playing life as if it were that game.
- You will lose,
- It will hurt the first fifty times. When you get used to losing, you will play each game with less emotion.
- I’m a little bit Canadian pacifist and reactive,
- My gameplay was a hundred percent reactive to what everyone else was doing, as opposed to thinking through my best strategy.
- Like in Polytopia, you only get a set number of turns in life,
- If we let a few of them slide, we will never get to Mars.
- Elon plays the game by always pushing the edge of what’s possible,
- And he’s always doubling down and putting everything back in the game to grow and grow. And it’s just like he’s just done his whole life.
- Dude, like, everyone’s swiping at you right now, but if you swipe back at too many, you’ll run out of resources,
- front minimization.
- I had to stop playing because it was destroying my marriage,
- I had to take Polytopia off my phone because it was taking up too many brain cycles,
- I started dreaming about Polytopia.
- We ask you to provide Ukraine with Starlink stations,
- We have the US military looking to help us with transport, State has offered humanitarian flights and some compensation,
- Folks are rallying for sure!
- Cool,
- Sounds good.
- Russia took offline a bunch of Ukraine communications infrastructure today, and a number of Starlink kits are already allowing Ukraine Armed Forces to continue operating theater command centers,
- These kits can be life or death, as the opponent is now focusing heavily on comms infrastructure. They are asking for more.
- Let’s offer to ship some field solar+battery kits,
- They can have some Tesla Powerwalls or Megapacks too.
- The conflict in Ukraine has provided Musk and SpaceX’s fledgling satellite network with a trial-by-fire that has whetted the appetite of many Western militaries,
- Commanders have been impressed by the company’s ability, within days, to deliver thousands of backpack-sized satellite stations to the war-torn country and to keep them online despite increasingly sophisticated attacks from Russian hackers.
- Without Starlink, we would have been losing the war,
- How many have we donated so far?
- 2000 free Starlinks and monthly service. Also, 300 heavily discounted to Lviv IT association and we waived the monthly service for ~5500.
- If you would like to contribute, please let me know as soon as you can,
- I cannot overstate the importance of the role Starlink has played in keeping the communications of the Ukrainian government from being taken out by the Russians.
- I’m in for $1M,
- Elon rocks.
- This could be a giant disaster,
- a non-trivial possibility,
- We made the sea drones ourselves, they can destroy any cruiser or submarine,
- I did not share this information with anyone. I just want you—the person who is changing the world through technology—to know this.
- is now going too far and inviting strategic defeat.
- I think if the Ukrainian attacks had succeeded in sinking the Russian fleet, it would have been like a mini Pearl Harbor and led to a major escalation,
- We did not want to be a part of that.
- neutral
- Fuck off is my very diplomatic reply to you,
- Which Elon Musk do you like more?: One who supports Ukraine, or One who supports Russia.
- SpaceX’s out of pocket cost to enable and support Starlink in Ukraine is ~$80M so far,
- Our support for Russia is $0. Obviously, we are pro Ukraine.
- Trying to retake Crimea will cause massive death, probably fail and risk nuclear war. This would be terrible for Ukraine and Earth.
- We initially gave the Ukrainians free service for humanitarian and defense purposes, such as keeping up their hospitals and banking systems,
- But then they started putting them on fucking drones trying to blow up Russian ships. I’m happy to donate services for ambulances and hospitals and mothers. That’s what companies and people should do. But it’s wrong to pay for military drone strikes.
- The hell with it,
- Even though Starlink is still losing money & other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we’ll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free.
- The Pentagon had a $145 million check ready to hand to me, literally. Then Elon succumbed to the bullshit on Twitter and to the haters at the Pentagon who leaked the story.
- No good deed goes unpunished,
- Even so, we should still do good deeds,
- Not everyone understands your contribution to Ukraine. I am confident that without Starlinks, we would be unable to function successfully. Thanks again.
- How am I in this war?
- Starlink was not meant to be involved in wars. It was so people can watch Netflix and chill and get online for school and do good peaceful things, not drone strikes.
- Hey, I’d love to come see you and talk about philanthropy and climate,
- I don’t have a scheduler,
- Just have your secretary call me directly.
- bizarre
- Just landed,
- Cool,
- I showed him the numbers,
- It’s an area where I clearly knew something that he didn’t.
- I’m not a Mars person,
- He’s overboard on Mars. I let him explain his Mars thinking to me, which is kind of bizarre thinking. It’s this crazy thing where maybe there’s a nuclear war on Earth and so the people on Mars are there and they’ll come back down and, you know, be alive after we all kill each other.
- Starlink is the realization of what I tried to do with Teledesic twenty years ago,
- bullshit.
- Hey, I’m going to show you five projects of a hundred million each,
- super-long description of the ideas.
- I apologized to him,
- Once he heard I’d shorted the stock, he was super mean to me, but he’s super mean to so many people, so you can’t take it too personally.
- How can someone say they are passionate about fighting climate change and then do something that reduced the overall investment in the company doing the most?
- It’s pure hypocrisy. Why make money on the failure of a sustainable energy car company?
- I imagine it’s a little bit of a dick-measuring contest.
- Do you still have a half billion dollar short position against Tesla?
- Just say yes, and then change the subject quickly,
- Sorry to say I haven’t closed it out,
- I would like to discuss philanthropy possibilities.
- Sorry,
- I cannot take your philanthropy on climate seriously when you have a massive short position against Tesla, the company doing the most to solve climate change.
- In case u need to lose a boner fast,
- At this point, I am convinced that he is categorically insane (and an asshole to the core),
- I did actually want to like him (sigh).
- You can feel whatever you want about Elon’s behavior,
- but there is no one in our time who has done more to push the bounds of science and innovation than he has.
- We’re going to do it like in baby steps,
- but ultimately it can become a pretty big thing, maybe a full-fledge institute of higher learning.
- I’ve got too much else to think about now,
- The super-weird thing is that Falcon 9 is still the only orbital booster to land or re-fly after all these years!
- You don’t have to be in a state of war at all times,
- Or, is it that you find greater comfort when you’re in periods of war?
- It’s part of my default settings,
- It was like he was winning the simulation and now felt at a loss for what to do,
- Extended periods of calm are unnerving for him.
- I guess I’ve always wanted to push my chips back on the table or play the next level of the game,
- I’m not good at sitting back.
- Normally, he would go into one of his companies and find something to turn into a crisis,
- I didn’t want to just leave it in the bank,
- so I asked myself what product I liked, and that was an easy question. It was Twitter.
- bored by tweets about what kind of latte somebody had at Starbucks.
- Got called randomly by Kanye West today and received a download of his thoughts, ranging from shoes to Moses,
- He was polite, but opaque.
- My tweets are like Niagara Falls sometimes and they come too fast,
- Just dip a cup in there and try to avoid the random turds.
- pedo guy
- funding secured
- shoots himself in the foot
- digs his own grave.
- Are you not entertained? Is that not why you are here?
- woke-mind virus
- He saw the direction Twitter was heading, which was that if you were on the wrong end of the spectrum you were censored,
- Our public square needs to not have arbitrary sketchy censorship,
- I’m actually speaking to over 100 members of congress tomorrow at GOP policy retreat and this is one of the ideas I’m pushing.
- Absolutely,
- What we have now is hidden corruption!
- Are you going to liberate Twitter from the censorship happy mob?
- I will provide advice, which they may or may not choose to follow,
- Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?
- Is a new platform needed?
- Yes.
- I’d like to help if I’m able to.
- This wins for the weirdest place I’ve had a meeting recently,
- There are tractors and donkeys.
- Maybe Airbnb’s algorithm thinks you love tractors and donkeys (who doesn’t).
- He’s a really nice guy,
- being a really nice guy.
- What Twitter needs is a fire-breathing dragon,
- and Parag is not that.
- the ultimate irony,
- the public square
- Well, if they’re going to roll out the red carpet, I’ll do it,
- I’m excited to share that we’re appointing @elonmusk to our board!
- He’s both a passionate believer and intense critic of the service, which is exactly what we need.
- Looking forward to working with Parag & Twitter board to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months!
- I interface way better with engineers who are able to do hardcore programming than with program manager/MBA types of people,
- I love our conversations!
- In our next convo, treat me like an engineer instead of CEO and let’s see where we get to,
- My two landlords!
- It’s probably a recipe for trouble,
- I had a bunch of cash sitting around!
- I think it’s important to have a forum that is trusted, or at least not too distrusted,
- Parag is a technologist and has a medium idea of what’s going on, but it’s very clear that the inmates are running the asylum.
- Twitter has to move more in the direction of free speech, at least as defined by the law,
- Right now, Twitter’s suppression of speech is far in excess of the law.
- Should it be like a telephone system, where the words that go in one end come out exactly the same on the other end?
- Or do you think this is more like a system that is governing the discourse of the world, and maybe there should be some intelligence put into the algorithm that prioritizes and deprioritizes things?
- Yeah, it’s a thorny question,
- There’s an ability to say something, and then there is also the issue of to what degree it’s promoted or demoted or amplified.
- It could be an open-source algorithm placed on GitHub so people can sift through it.
- What if we charged people a small amount, like two dollars a month, to be verified?
- It could fulfill my original vision for X.com and PayPal,
- I probably spend too much time on Twitter,
- It’s a good place to dig your own grave. You get your shoulder into it, and you keep on digging.
- If we’re not blowing up engines, we’re not trying hard enough,
- Full Self-Driving,
- is going to revolutionize the world.
- I made an offer
- They’re nice, but none of them use Twitter,
- I don’t feel like anything will happen.
- Dude, you’ve never been on a board, so you don’t know how much this is going to suck for you,
- You tell people what you think, and then they smile and nod and ignore you.
- a blockchain social media system that does both payments and short text messages like Twitter.
- there’d be no throat to choke, so free speech is guaranteed.
- I began to believe that Twitter was heading off a cliff and that I couldn’t save it by just being a board member,
- So I thought, maybe I should just buy it, take it private, and fix it.
- Most of these ‘top’ accounts tweet rarely and post very little content. Is Twitter dying?
- You are free to tweet ‘Is twitter dying?’ or anything else about Twitter, but it’s my responsibility to tell you that it’s not helping me make Twitter better in the current context.
- distractions
- hurting our ability to do work.
- What did you get done this week?
- I’m not joining the board. This is a waste of time. Will make an offer to take Twitter private.
- Can we talk?
- I’d love to learn more,
- I’ve dug deep on Web3 (not crypto as much) and the voting powers are amazing and verified. Blockchain prevents people from deleting tweets. Pros and cons, but let the games begin!
- I think a new social media company is needed that is based on the blockchain and includes payments,
- Please expect a take private offer,
- Do you have five minutes so I can understand the context?
- Fixing Twitter by chatting with Parag won’t work,
- Drastic action is needed.
- It has been 24 hours since you joined the board,
- I get your point, but just want to understand the sudden pivot.
- I’m about to take off, but can talk tomorrow,
- I was basically being rope-a-doped,
- They would listen, nod, and then not do anything. I decided I didn’t want to be co-opted and be some sort of quisling on the board.
- This is real,
- There is no way to fix the company as a 9% shareholder, and the public markets have trouble thinking past the next quarter. Twitter needs to scrub out the bots and scammers, which will seem like a massive drop in daily users.
- Call me when you have a minute.
- Convert Twitter SF HQ to homeless shelter since no one shows up anyway?
- Hey—can you speak this evening?
- I’ve seen your tweets and feel more urgency about understanding your position.
- Sounds good,
- It is better, in my opinion, to take Twitter private, restructure and return to the public markets once that is done.
- Elon’s appointment to the board was to become officially effective 4/9, but Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board. I believe this is for the best. We have and will always value input from our shareholders whether they are on our board or not.
- take private
- This may be the most overplayed joke,
- Plan B.
- My grandpa is an engineer, and he’s just been wanting a great-grandchild for so long,
- and my grandma’s super old and is just barely holding on.
- I could tell that he was in stress mode and all the Twitter stuff was happening,
- After several days of deliberation—this is obviously a matter of serious gravity—I have decided to move forward with taking Twitter private,
- I will send you an offer letter tonight.
- I played a couple of hours, then answered some texts and emails, then played some more,
- Instead of sleeping,
- he played until five-thirty in the morning.
- I made an offer.
- Why are you doing this?
- What about your time and sanity?
- Tesla and SpaceX still need your help. How long would it take to turn Twitter around?
- At least five years,
- I would have to get rid of much of the staff. They don’t work hard or even show up.
- Do you want to go through all that pain?
- You slept on the factory floor for Tesla, doubled down for SpaceX. Do you really want to take all this on again?
- Yes, I actually would,
- I wouldn’t mind.
- We have to match the functionality of WeChat,
- One of the most important things will be enabling people who create content to get paid on Twitter.
- open the aperture
- We want to prevent a world in which people split off into their own echo chambers on social media, like going to Parler or Truth Social,
- We want to have one place where people with different viewpoints can interact. That would be a good thing for civilization.
- I don’t think from a cognitive standpoint it’s nearly as hard as SpaceX or Tesla,
- It’s not like getting to Mars. It’s not as hard as changing the entire industrial base of Earth to sustainable energy.
- At first I thought it didn’t fit into my primary large missions,
- But I’ve come to believe it can be part of the mission of preserving civilization, buying our society more time to become multiplanetary.
- There seems to be more and more group-think in the media, toeing the line, so if you weren’t in step, you’re just going to be ostracized or your voice will be shut off.
- No,
- it was because I went to a party with friends and drank too much Red Bull.
- But it gives me wings?
- Yes, of course,
- Roughly what dollar size?
- Not holding you to anything, but the deal is oversubscribed, so I have to reduce or kick out some participants.
- A billion,
- or whatever you recommend.
- It’s a real-time news service, and there’s nothing really like it,
- If you agree it’s important for a democracy, then I thought it was worth making an investment in it.
- I’m backlogged with a mountain of critical work matters,
- ls this urgent?
- would do the engineering for social media blockchain integration
- could do $5bn if everything vision lock,
- dislike
- Blockchain Twitter isn’t possible, as the bandwidth and latency requirements cannot be supported by a peer to peer network.
- so long as I don’t have to have a laborious blockchain debate.
- really excited about what you’ll do with TWTR.
- roll,
- Sorry, who is sending this message?
- You’re welcome to roll.
- My bullshit detector went off like red alert on a Geiger counter,
- He was talking like he was on speed or Adderall, a mile a minute,
- I thought he was supposed to be asking me questions about the deal, but he kept telling me the things he was doing. And I was thinking, ‘Dude, calm down.’ 
- This is the right path,
- I’ll continue to do whatever it takes to make it work.
- I think it’s important to have a digital public square that’s inclusive and trusted,
- How else are we going to get Trump elected in 2024?
- They thought that I was asking for trouble,
- They said they didn’t know the precise answer,
- I was like, ‘What do you mean? You don’t know?’ The whole exchange was so preposterous that if it was in that Silicon Valley sitcom, you’d think this is just too ridiculous. My jaw was really aching from hitting the floor so many times.
- It was the worst diligence meeting I have ever witnessed in my life,
- I did not make the deal contingent on full due diligence, but I did believe they could justify their own public disclosures. Otherwise it was fraud.
- There’s no way to move forward after what they said,
- The forty-four-billion-dollar price requires taking on a lot of debt, both the company and me personally. I think Twitter may be headed off the rails. It might work out, at a much lower price, I mean literally half or something.
- I’ve got a bad habit of biting off more than I can chew,
- I think I just need to think about Twitter less. Even this conversation right now is not time well spent.
- Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users.
- Still committed to acquisition.
- everything app,
- It was one of those examples of Elon just being Elon and accepting an invitation without talking to any of us or getting prepped,
- Does anyone know who Jared Birchall is?
- I think there’s a distinction between freedom of speech and freedom of reach,
- Anyone can just go into the middle of Times Square and say anything, even deny the Holocaust. But that doesn’t mean that needs to be promoted to millions of people.
- You want as many people as possible on Twitter,
- For that to happen, people must enjoy being on Twitter. If they’re being harassed or made uncomfortable, they’re not going to use Twitter. We have to strike this balance of allowing people to say what they want to say, but also making people comfortable.
- I believe in a strict meritocracy,
- Whoever is doing great work, they get more responsibility. And that’s that.
- My political views, I think, are moderate, close to the center.
- Happy Father’s Day. I love all my kids so much.
- Jenna,
- I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form,
- It’s full-on communism, and a general sentiment that if you’re rich, you’re evil,
- We are simultaneously being told that gender differences do not exist and that genders are so profoundly different that irreversible surgery is the only option,
- Perhaps someone wiser than me can explain this dichotomy.
- It is a better world if we are all less judgy.
- He loves Jenna so much and truly accepts her,
- I’ve never seen him as heartbroken about anything. I know he’d do anything to be able to see her or have her, like, accept him again.
- When Jenna deleted ‘Musk’ from her name, he was just really sad,
- And he asked me, ‘Hey, would you be open to our twins taking my name?’ 
- Doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis,
- A collapsing birth rate is the biggest danger civilization faces by far.
- Tau is so amazing,
- He came out with eyes that could just see so deeply into your soul, with so much knowledge. He looks like a little Spock. He’s definitely a Vulcan.
- I had more kids in Q2 than they made cars!
- I mean, I love my own humor, even if others don’t,
- I kill me.
- The amount of attention on me has gone supernova, which super sucks,
- Unfortunately, even trivial articles about me generate a lot of clicks :( Will try my best to be heads down focused on doing useful things for civilization.
- Father’s Day,
- I’m sitting here freezing cold in a hanger wrapped in blankets and newspapers. There is no electricity. If I’m bothered to write to you like this, you can bother to read it.
- freak, criminal, pedophile president
- including you.
- With no Whites here, the Blacks will go back to the trees.
- the only world leader talking.
- TRUMP WON—F**K Joe Biden,
- This is irrefutable.
- a lie,
- At 76, I cannot generate income easily,
- The alternative for me is starvation and unbearable humiliation or death by suicide. Death by suicide does not worry me, but it should worry you. The truth is too well known. You will be ruined, make no mistake, and people will know who you really are, or have become.
- National Socialist, cruel, self-serving and cowardly maternal family background,
- Has the wickedness that was the Haldeman’s prevailed?
- My silence to enable the devilish sh,t to continue brewing is not worth $2,000,
- It’s also wrong to silence me. I have much to teach people.
- The only thing we are on Earth for is to reproduce,
- If I could have another child I would. I can’t see any reason not to.
- We just watched stupid TV and laughed and hung out and he just made me laugh instead of cry,
- I can’t get over how completely gorgeous they all are,
- Griffin is handsome, hilarious and still an utter charmer, Damian has blossomed into an incredibly sophisticated and beautiful soul, Kai is still a thoroughly decent chap and now so gorgeously geeky, and Saxon’s language development is more than I could have possibly hoped for—we had full and detailed conversations. Except at one point he said, ‘The interesting thing about you and Elon is you have a significant age gap… But you look the same.’ .
- My suit is tragic,
- One thing I’ve been harassing him about, lovingly, is finding a place he can call home,
- He needs a place where his soul resides, and that’s what the horse farm will be for him.
- It should be like something fell out of space, like a structure from another galaxy landed in the lake,
- It’s more an art project than a house,
- cuteness prop.
- I’m suppressing my maternal instincts,
- He’s fearless,
- He could probably use more fear instincts. It’s genetic.
- Falcon nine,
- No,
- Starship.
- Ten, nine, eight,
- People say he’s so smart to be able to count backwards,
- But I’m not sure he can count forward.
- Among my friends, the average number of kids is one,
- Some have zero. I try to set a good example.
- If China gets to the moon before we do again, it will be a Sputnik moment,
- It’s going to be a shock when we wake up and realize they got to the moon while we were suing each other.
- The answer I give is to challenge authority.
- There have to be things that inspire you, that move your heart,
- Being a space-faring civilization, making science fiction not fiction, is one of those.
- Every time I see the tower my heart soars,
- That would have been strike three,
- We were one strike away from Americans saying ‘Screw space.’ 
- Yes,
- it was better to send up four people out of central casting.
- Do you want me to send a few people down to Boca?
- Yes,
- You should go there as well.
- He is quite charismatic in a goofy, hard-ass way,
- He can tell people they are fucking up and their idea sucks, but do it in a way that doesn’t make them mad. He’s my Mark Antony.
- Bill is a great person, but he has a hard time giving anyone negative feedback and just can’t fire anyone,
- Sam works his ass off,
- but he doesn’t know how to give Elon bad news. Sam and Bill are chickens.
- These timelines are bullshit, a mega fail,
- Like, no fucking way these should take so long.
- We are going to go through the first-principles algorithm every night, questioning requirements and deleting,
- That’s what we did to unfuck the bullshit that was Raptor.
- That’s too long,
- This is critical for all of human destiny. It’s hard to change destiny. You can’t just do it from nine to five.
- See you guys tonight,
- I’ve got a Tesla shareholder meeting this afternoon, and I haven’t even seen the slides yet.
- Rockets!
- It doesn’t seem like we need shields in all those places,
- I went out there with a flashlight, and the heat shields are blocking things so you can’t see jack shit.
- What have we decided?
- If we get in trouble, we can blame it all on you, Jake,
- Is that really you?
- Yes,
- You got to take risks. You got to love taking risks.
- The prior schedule for the booster was ten days to pad,
- However, I’m 90% sure that we will discover our next showstopper development issue without needing B7 to be complete.
- One way or another, we are going to put B7 back on the launch mount by midnight tonight or sooner.
- Occupy Mars
- Why is that part needed?
- Why can’t that be done faster?
- I think he does that so everyone can see how much he’s hustling,
- No,
- I did it because I forgot to put on sunscreen and didn’t want to get burned.
- It’s true that if they see the general out on the battlefield, the troops are going to be motivated. Wherever Napoleon was, that’s where his armies would do best. Even if I don’t do anything but show up, they’ll look at me and say that at least I wasn’t spending all night partying.
- I love the smell of hydraulic fluid in the morning,
- I feel like he’s developing a higher than average tolerance for danger,
- His tolerance for danger is almost problematic, honestly.
- We want to make it as human as possible,
- But we can also add improvements to what humans can do.
- That would be useful if the robot needed to push against a wall,
- It could do it without putting pressure on the fingers.
- Wow,
- but people would get a bit freaked out. Let’s not go that far.
- Now the challenging part,
- How do we make this sausage look good?
- Start with figuring out what the fingers will look like and how they will taper, especially since we’re going to elongate the pinky. Elon wants feminine tapers for the fingers.
- We could look at the current in the actuator of the finger joint, which will correlate to the pressure being applied to the tip,
- What are the differences in cost?
- It needs to be able to pick up a pencil from any angle,
- Maybe the robots could swap their arms with different tools,
- It can be display only,
- It doesn’t need to be a touch screen. But you should be able to know what it’s doing from afar.
- I think the Mars simulation is fun,
- but we should do one that shows the robots working in one of our factories, maybe performing the repetitive tasks that no one wants to do.
- Do you remember the original Blade Runner movie did something like that,
- Also the most recent Cyberpunk game.
- Maybe we should have the charger cord plug into the butt,
- The giggle factor would be too high,
- For humans, orifices are a big deal.
- This is reminding me of Young Frankenstein,
- It’s epic.
- stop command path,
- There can’t be a scenario where somebody could gain access to the mothership and take control of the robots in a way that’s malicious,
- deadly robot armies.
- our robots are going to work harder than humans work.
- The Optimus humanoid robot,
- has the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business.
- degrees of freedom,
- The answer is we want the three degrees of freedom, so we have to figure out how we get there more efficiently,
- This is a shitty design. I eyeball it and it looks terrible. Use the damn lift gate actuators from our cars, which we know how to make cheaply.
- Pretend we are a startup about to run out of money,
- Faster. Faster! Please mark anytime a date has slipped. All bad news should be given loudly and often. Good news can be said quietly and once.
- At first kids walk flatfooted, then they begin walking on their toes, but they still walk like a monkey,
- It takes them quite a while before they walk like an adult. The gait is rather complicated.
- First steps on the ground!
- But we have not been able to coordinate the arms and legs to keep it in balance,
- If we put in several cameras,
- we won’t need to swivel the head.
- Whenever Elon pulls out his phone to take a video, you know that you’ve impressed him,
- In all of these,
- we’re tackling the huge task of creating artificial general intelligence.
- If you can present this to me with a straight face, then you’re probably not the guy for the job,
- Since I presented this to you with a straight face, you’re right,
- I’m probably not the right guy for the job.
- You said when you left the Tesla board that I should call you if I need help,
- For nearly two months, Mr. Musk has sought the data and information necessary to make an independent assessment of the prevalence of fake or spam accounts,
- right to terminate the Merger Agreement.
- refuses to honor his obligations to Twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests.
- I’m calling him right now to tell him no more tweeting,
- So much for the conversation about tweeting,
- I’m buying Manchester United ur welcome,
- Is he really going to?
- No, this is a long-running joke on Twitter. I’m not buying any sports teams.
- I do what I normally do, which is create serendipity,
- I called him up and said, ‘I want to meet you.’ We were just two young pishers trying to fucking figure it out, and we became friends.
- because I wanted to fucking get out of that goddamn Prius,
- Diddy
- Do you just want to murder kids in schools?
- No, no,
- I’m anti–kid murder.
- Then how could you vote Republican?
- His tweets about voting Republican because Democrats were the party of division and hate were sticking in my craw,
- Even if Uvalde never happened, I probably would have brought it up, because I was angry and offended.
- I had told Ari I was not a big fan of Elon, so he seated me with him,
- Elon stayed pretty quiet.
- I actually thought that would be a great table.
- You’re being a fucking fool,
- Go over and talk to him.
- he tried to kiss my ring,
- We are never going to give them a legal release,
- We will hunt every single one of them till the day they die.
- They are shitting bricks about the dumpster fire they’re in,
- I cannot believe that the judge will railroad the deal through. It would not pass muster with the public.
- The problem,
- is that the board members own so little of the stock that recovering from them would be difficult.
- Arguably, I should just pay full price, because these people running Twitter are such blockheads and idiots,
- Its stock was seventy last year with such a ship of fools. The potential is so great. There are so many things I could fix.
- We’d operate it, but he would tell us what he wanted and be in charge of all the engineering and technical stuff,
- We do a ton of business with advertisers, and it’s not like we haven’t done this before, you know?
- the most insulting, demeaning, insane message.
- Look, I appreciate the offer,
- But Twitter is a tech company, a programming company.
- My psychic health goes in waves,
- It’s bad when there is extreme pressure. But if a lot of things start going right, it’s also not great for my psychic health.
- Burnt hair perfume!
- Do you like that smell you experienced after the flamethrower? We have that scent for you!
- Please buy my perfume, so I can buy Twitter.
- Activate,
- I think I have PTSD,
- After last time, it’s really hard to stay composed.
- But I decided that the mission was too important,
- You remember how you hated my planned presentation and kept telling me how horrible it was?
- And everyone was worried I had quit?
- The Ministry of Silly Walks.
- It looked cooler with the groovy walk,
- Humanoid robots will uncork the economy to quasi-infinite levels,
- Robot workers would solve the problem of lack of population growth,
- Yes, but people should still have kids,
- We want human consciousness to survive.
- For Lease
- I’m supposed to be fasting now, but I just have to get something here,
- Do you still have the teriyaki bowl?
- I wonder if it will still be here twenty-five years from now so X can bring his kids here?
- I can’t believe this is happening,
- I worked for months without a day off and got so tired that I quit Tesla right after Autonomy Day,
- I was burned out. But after nine months, I was bored, so I called my boss and begged him to let me come back. I decided I’d rather be burned out than bored.
- When you’re at Tesla, you’re afraid to go anywhere else, because you will become so bored.
- I’m going to spend the next few days off with my wife and daughter,
- but if I take a whole week off, my brain gets fried.
- This is the first time we are going to try this robot without any backup support, cranes, mechanisms—no cables, nothing!
- It moved, it’s working,
- Our goal is to make a useful humanoid robot as quickly as possible,
- This means a future of abundance, a future where there is no poverty. We can afford to have a universal basic income we give people. It really is a fundamental transformation of civilization.
- Our main focus has to be volume,
- There is no amount that we could possibly build that will be enough. Someday we want to be at twenty million a year.
- What if someone forgets to shut the door of the Robotaxi when they get out?
- We have to make sure it can shut its own doors.
- Maybe it needs an arm that can punch a button or take a ticket,
- Perhaps we just exclude it from places that you can’t easily drive into,
- We want to make sure we are assessing the risk with you,
- If we go down a path of having no steering wheel, and FSD is not ready, we won’t be able to put them on the road.
- Basically our proposal is to bake them in right now but remove them when we are allowed to.
- Small ones,
- which we can remove pretty easily and design around.
- No,
- No. NO.
- No mirrors, no pedals, no steering wheel. This is me taking responsibility for this decision.
- Uh, we will come back to you on that,
- Let me be clear,
- This vehicle must be designed as a clean Robotaxi. We’re going to take that risk. It’s my fault if it fucks up. But we are not going to design some sort of amphibian frog that’s a halfway car. We are all in on autonomy.
- This will be a historically mega-revolutionary product,
- It will transform everything. This is the product that makes Tesla a ten-trillion company. People will be talking about this moment in a hundred years.
- all in
- We brought him new information that maybe he wasn’t fully digesting in the summer,
- We convinced him that if we build these factories and we have this platform, we could churn out both Robotaxis and a $25,000 car, all on the same vehicle architecture,
- It’s really not that exciting of a product,
- When one of these comes around a corner,
- people will think they are seeing something from the future.
- the next generation platform.
- Tesla engineering will need to be on the line to make it successful, and getting everyone to move to Mexico is never going to happen,
- Let that sink in
- I am very excited about finally implementing X.com as it should have been done, using Twitter as an accelerant!
- And, hopefully, helping democracy and civil discourse while doing so.
- I will need to live at Twitter HQ. This is a super tough situation. Really bumming me out :( Sleep is difficult.
- I have a lot of optimism,
- Elon can inspire people to do things bigger than themselves.
- Let that sink in!
- Let’s party on!
- Gender diversity is welcome here,
- Stay woke,
- I drink tap water,
- We were definitely very high-empathy, very caring about inclusion and diversity; everyone needs to feel safe here,
- day of rest
- psychological safety.
- psychological safety.
- hardcore.
- mental rest
- We want to build a way to have media makers get paid for their work,
- Could you put it in the microwave and heat it up to super-hot?
- If it’s not super-hot, I chug it too fast.
- We need to make Twitter the number-one payment system in the world, like I wanted to do at X.com,
- If you have a wallet connected to a money-market account, that’s the key piece that makes the crystal glow.
- Can I give you an idea in nineteen seconds?
- Some will want teddy bears and puppies, others will love combat and say ‘Bring it all on.’ 
- Are you going to fire seventy-five percent of us?
- No, that number didn’t come from me,
- This unnamed sources bullshit has to stop. But we do face a challenge. We are headed to recession, and revenue is below cost, so we have to find ways to bring in more money or reduce costs.
- Have you spoken to Jack?
- He’s agreed to fully roll,
- We are still friends. He worries about liquidity in the future, so I gave him my word at $54.20.
- Hi,
- How was your day?
- My brain is full,
- It will take a night of sleep to turn the data into something.
- for cause
- There’s two-hundred-million differential in the cookie jar between closing tonight and doing it tomorrow morning,
- pedo guy
- take private
- We can’t fire Parag until he signs the certificate, right?
- I would rather fire them before the thing is consummated,
- exited
- He tried to resign,
- But we beat him,
- Trick or Tweet.
- Ned Segal came costumed as a CFO.
- Let that sink in!
- Explore
- We had worked on many possible new features for years, but no one ever made decisions about them,
- Suddenly, we had this guy making rapid decisions.
- He had just come from closing the Twitter deal, and I was surprised that we didn’t talk about it,
- He seemed to want to talk about other things.
- voluntold
- You’ve got to be there,
- My ex-girlfriend hated me for it,
- Maybe that’s why she’s my ex-girlfriend.
- Dude, that’s disgusting,
- I would meet people and say, ‘Where should I go next?,’ which is how I ended up in Genoa.
- Oh, that’s my cousin’s company,
- They sent me back because I was the smallest and meekest-looking one,
- Do a search to see who’s done a hundred lines of code or more in the last month,
- I want you to go through the directory and see who’s committing code.
- Let’s figure out who did a nontrivial amount of coding, then within that group who did the best coding,
- I have the list of everyone’s insertions and deletions,
- Can you send it?
- Thanks for helping, man,
- Elon?
- In my experience, individuals are important, but the teams are also important,
- Instead of just singling out good coders, I think it would be useful to find the teams that work really well together.
- Me and James and the people on our Autopilot team are always sitting together, and the ideas flow real fast, and what we do as a team is better than what any one of us could do,
- I believe in coming in, and I do,
- But I’m a programmer and can’t be good if I get interrupted every hour. So sometimes I don’t come in. Perhaps hybrid is best.
- I have an idea on the ads,
- Ask people who subscribe what their interests are and offer to personalize their experience. You could make it a benefit of subscribing.
- Yeah, and advertisers would love that,
- Also a down-vote button for tweets,
- You need some negative user signal that can feed into rankings.
- Only paid and verified users should be allowed to do a down-vote,
- because otherwise you could be subject to a bot attack.
- Why don’t you come back to work here?
- It seems like you love it.
- Well, I’m conflicted,
- I look up to you. I’ve purchased every product you ever created. Let me get back to you.
- I just don’t see a role for me,
- Elon is passionate about directly driving engineering and product himself.
- Twitter now has twenty-five hundred software engineers,
- If each wrote only three lines of code per day, a ridiculously low bar, that should make three million lines a year, which is enough for a whole operating system. This is not happening. Something is deeply amiss. I feel like I’m in a comedy show here.
- Product managers who don’t know anything about coding keep ordering up features they don’t know how to create,
- Like cavalry generals who don’t know how to ride a horse.
- I’m going to set a rule,
- We have one hundred fifty engineers doing Autopilot. I want to get down to that number at Twitter.
- I don’t understand why every single person that works at a social media company has to have one-sixty IQ and work twenty hours a day,
- They were pretty unhappy,
- They argued that the company would just crash.
- Elon has asked for this, and this is how he operates, so we have to come up with a plan.
- In an effort to place Twitter on a healthy path, we will go through the difficult process of reducing our global work force.
- Kanye’s belief in himself and his incredible tenacity got him to where he is today,
- He fought for his place in the cultural pantheon with a purpose. He’s not afraid of being judged or ridiculed in the process.
- White Lives Matter
- When I wake up I’m going death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE.
- Talked to Ye today & expressed my concerns about his recent tweet, which I think he took to heart.
- I won’t make any decisions about who to reinstate until the council is up and running,
- No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes,
- advisory,
- I have to make the ultimate calls.
- No, it’s not really a priority now.
- I’ve never donated to a presidential campaign before, but I just gave $100 to Hillary for America,
- We can’t f—k around anymore.
- I’m just saying, we fly over those states that voted for a racist tangerine for a reason.
- ACTUAL NAZIS IN THE WHITE HOUSE,
- personality-free bag of farts.
- Hi, this is Yoni,
- Can you please come over to the second floor? We need to talk.
- I’m Israeli myself, so I could tell he was Israeli,
- But otherwise I had no idea who he was.
- Elon is absolutely paranoid, and with reason, that some angry employee is going to disrupt things,
- He’s made it my job to stop it.
- How do I get access to Twitter’s tools?
- There’s a lot of restrictions on who gets access to Twitter tools,
- There’s a lot of privacy considerations.
- Well there’s been a corporate transition,
- I work for Elon and we need to secure things. At least show me what the tools look like.
- Can you be trusted?
- Okay, I’m going to go and get Elon,
- Access to those tools should be restricted to just one person for now,
- I did that yesterday,
- The one person is me.
- you would trust with your life
- I mean, trust with your life,
- Because if they do something wrong, they’re fired and you’re fired and your entire team is fired.
- misgendering
- Man of the Year.
- If you ever need something or anything crazy comes up, call me directly,
- Why can’t he just do that?
- Well, he can,
- He bought the company, and he can make whatever decisions he wants.
- What do we do when another user does the same thing and our rules are enforced? You have a consistency problem.
- Okay, then, should we change the policy?
- You can do that,
- But you should know this is a major culture war issue.
- If the very first thing that he does is remove Twitter’s hateful conduct policy related to misgendering, I don’t believe it will go well.
- We need to talk to Elon about this.
- Elon wants to reinstate Jordan Peterson.
- Well, what about the concept of a presidential pardon?
- That’s in the Constitution, right?
- What if somebody else does the same thing?
- We’re not changing the rules, we’re granting them a pardon,
- But on social media, it doesn’t exactly work that way,
- People test the rules, especially on this issue, and they’re going to want to know if Twitter’s policy has changed.
- Look, I want to be clear, I don’t think misgendering people is cool. But it’s not sticks and stones, like if you threaten to kill somebody.
- I actually agreed with him,
- Even though I had a reputation of being the censorship brigade, it was actually my long-standing view that Twitter removed too much speech when there were other, less invasive options available.
- That sounds like exactly what we should do,
- These problem tweets shouldn’t show up in search. They shouldn’t show up in your timeline, but like, if you navigate to somebody’s profile, maybe you see them.
- One of the biggest areas I’d love research on is non-removal policy interventions like disabling engagements and de-amplification/visibility filtering,
- the Twitter Files
- shadow banning
- visibility filtering
- Instead,
- why don’t we take a couple of days to build a version of what this de-amplification system could be.
- I can do this for you by Monday,
- Sounds good,
- You should do it,
- speech cartel
- Board member, advisor, whatever… you have my sword,
- Put me in the game coach! Twitter CEO is my dream job.
- What is going on with you marketing an SPV to randos?
- This is not ok.
- This deal has just captured the world’s imagination in an unimaginable way. It’s bonkers…. I’m ride or die brother—I’d jump on a grenade for you.
- It was clearly a coordinated thing,
- not just actual people being more racist.
- So what’s going on with this racist stuff?
- It’s a troll campaign,
- Burn that stuff down right away,
- Nuke it.
- Hate speech has no place on Twitter,
- Can’t do it.
- Why don’t you post some tweets about it?
- We’ve been focused on addressing the surge in hateful conduct on Twitter,
- More than 50,000 tweets repeatedly using a particular slur came from just 300 accounts. Nearly all of these accounts are inauthentic. We’ve taken action to ban the users involved in this trolling campaign.
- To be super clear,
- we have not yet made any changes to Twitter’s content moderation policies.
- He told me that he thought some of my old tweets were funny, and he was genuinely supportive even though a lot of conservatives were calling for my head,
- We’ve all made some questionable tweets, me more than most, but I want to be clear that I support Yoel,
- My sense is that he has high integrity, and we are all entitled to our political beliefs.
- What the fuck is this?
- spread hate and deranged conspiracy theories
- in a dispute with a male prostitute.
- There is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye.
- It’s definitely going to be a problem with advertisers,
- Dear Twitter advertisers
- Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences!
- There’s been an aggressive campaign against me ever since the deal was announced in April,
- Activist groups have been pushing to stop advertisers from signing deals.
- I want Twitter to be interesting to a broad number of people, maybe someday a billion,
- That goes hand-in-hand with safety. If you are hit with a barrage of hate speech or get attacked, you’re going to leave.
- I am who I am,
- My Twitter account is an extension of me personally, and, like, I’m going to tweet some things that are going to be stupid, and I’m going to make mistakes.
- What the fuck?
- Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists,
- They’re trying to destroy free speech in America.
- devil’s champion
- What he symbolizes,
- is the combination of the civil and military cooperation and teamwork that makes the United States the most powerful country in space.
- I cut a very small number of roles that I thought were nonessential, but nobody pressured me to fire people,
- core moderation capabilities remain in place.
- Bird Watch.
- From now on we’re calling it Community Notes,
- let collective humanity start a conversation and negotiate whether it was true or false.
- A thermonuclear name & shame is exactly what will happen if this continues,
- Twitter is a good thing,
- It is morally right for it to exist. These people are doing something immoral.
- I think tonight is the night I’m going to have to quit,
- It’s unfair,
- It’s blackmail.
- These tweets are not a violation of our rules,
- If you remove them, it’s going to backfire.
- I’m changing Twitter policy right now,
- Blackmail is prohibited as of right now. Ban it. Ban them.
- Let me see what I can find out,
- I was like, I need to get the fuck off the phone,
- You know how this shit works,
- If we ban an activist campaign, that is a great way to make it take off even more.
- Don’t do anything,
- I’ll text Elon too and then he’ll hear it from multiple people.
- He and I suddenly went back to having normal interactions, where he’s asking questions and I’m giving him answers,
- because some damn fool went into the Oval Office and did what Nixon told him to do.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
- That happens with Elon. You need to just ignore it and don’t do what he says. Then later on, go back to him after he has processed the inputs.
- notables
- There will be a massive attack,
- There’s going to be a swarm of bad actors who will test the defenses. They will try to impersonate me and others and then go to the press, which will want to destroy us. It will be World War Three over the blue check marks. So we have to do everything possible to not have this be a total exploding-egg-on-face situation.
- Don’t even think about it right now,
- There is only one priority: stopping the massive impersonation onslaught that’s going to happen.
- We are excited to announce insulin is free now.
- If this gets 1000 retweets we will put cocaine back in Coca-Cola.
- Our cars do not respect school zone speed limits. Fuck them kids,
- BREAKING: A second Tesla has hit the World Trade Center.
- This is one of the most terrifying financial pictures I have ever seen,
- I think we may see in excess of a $2 billion shortfall of cash next year.
- There is no way to sugarcoat the message,
- Frankly, the economic picture ahead is dire.
- The road ahead is arduous and will require intense work.
- Remote work is no longer allowed,
- Starting tomorrow, everyone is required to be in the office for a minimum of 40 hours per week.
- People are way more productive when they’re in person because the communication is much better,
- Let me be crystal clear,
- If people do not return to the office when they are able to return to the office, they cannot remain at the company. End of story. If you can show up in an office and you do not show up at the office: resignation accepted. End of story.
- The problem was that nobody bothered to fucking check if Apple would share this information,
- This is not going to work,
- The fundamental premise of Twitter Blue is flawed when it comes to the iPhone.
- Have you called somebody at Apple?
- Just call Apple and tell them to give you the data you need.
- tell me to go fuck myself.
- If I need to call Apple, I’ll call Apple,
- I’ll call Tim Cook, if I have to.
- Wow,
- I thought he was going to be doing this with us.
- I didn’t answer the calls while I was driving, because I’m a very nervous driver at the best of times,
- Can we talk?
- Is there anything we can do to persuade you to come back?
- I’m available to talk.
- Would you consider coming back?
- No, that’s not the right decision for me,
- He was reasonable, funny, engaging, and would talk about his vision in a way that was a bit bullshit but mainly something you could totally be inspired by,
- He was the bad Elon, and that’s the one I couldn’t take.
- People want me to say I hate him, but it’s much more complicated, which, I suppose, is what makes him interesting. He’s a bit of an idealist, right? He has a set of grand visions, whether it’s multiplanetary humanity or renewable energy and even free speech. And he has constructed for himself a moral and ethical universe that is focused on the delivery of those big goals. I think that makes it hard to villainize him.
- I just wanted to walk away while my reputation was still intact and I could still be employable,
- I was very worried that if Elon and I parted on bad terms, he would tweet bad things about me and call me a libtard, and then his hundred million followers, some of whom may be violent, would come after me and my family.
- What Elon doesn’t understand,
- is that the rest of us do not have security people the way he does.
- I don’t know why I did it,
- The judge basically said that I have to buy Twitter or else, and now I’m like, okay, shit.
- I’m hoping to be out of Twitter hell at some point,
- However bad you may think the Twitter culture is, multiply that by ten,
- The laziness and entitlement here is insane.
- I’d be careful what you wish for,
- I’m not sure how many people would actually like to be me. The amount that I torture myself is next level, frankly.
- I’m a big believer that a small number of exceptional people who are highly motivated can do better than a large number of people who are pretty good and moderately motivated,
- People at the company were shit-posting things about Elon, and he said he needed a few of us there he could trust,
- I just felt like shit that we were going to fire another eighty percent of the company.
- I just woke up and puked,
- I had never done that before.
- I went out and felt I didn’t want to be here now,
- I didn’t want to let down James.
- the hot box,
- the goon squad.
- We got a shit-show here,
- I’d be surprised if there were three hundred excellent engineers in this company.
- We can’t afford to go down then,
- I got the sense this could be bad,
- He told us to find the people who might be disgruntled or a threat,
- Elon,
- turdburger,
- One guy literally wrote a command that could take down a whole data center and said, ‘I wonder what happens if you run this,’ 
- He posted it.
- It seems like we were violating privacy and free speech and all that stuff,
- They had a culture of shitting on their bosses.
- It’s striking a balance in a company,
- To what extent do you allow dissent?
- Do you want to speak to this person and show them what they’ve said?
- Please let me go with severance and I will leave,
- We were so excited,
- We won’t have to do all this additional firing.
- I have a great idea,
- We’re flipping it. Don’t make the choice opt-out. Instead, make it opt-in. We want to make it sound like the Shackleton expedition. We want people who declare they are hardcore.
- Anyone who actually writes software, please report to the 10th floor at 2pm today.
- Please be prepared to do brief code reviews as I’m walking around the office.
- The mood had gotten edgy by then, and I think Elon was keeping them waiting on purpose,
- The pizza calmed things.
- desk-siding,
- Kathy Griffin, Jordan Peterson & Babylon Bee have been reinstated,
- Trump decision has not yet been made.
- visibility-filtering
- New Twitter policy is freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach,
- Negative/hate tweets will be max deboosted & demonetized, so no ads or other revenue to Twitter. You won’t find the tweet unless you specifically seek it out.
- a giant hoax.
- My firstborn child died in my arms,
- I felt his last heartbeat. I have no mercy for anyone who would use the deaths of children for gain, politics or fame.
- I love Hitler.
- Let’s always remember this as my final tweet,
- I tried my best,
- Despite that, Ye again violated our rule against incitement to violence. Account will be suspended.
- I want to avoid the bullshit disputes about Trump,
- If he’s engaged in criminal activity—it seems increasingly that he has—that’s not okay,
- It’s not free speech to subvert democracy.
- Look what I just tweeted,
- Reinstate former President Trump? Yes. No.
- shitting bricks,
- The people have spoken,
- Trump will be reinstated. Vox Populi, Vox Dei.
- I’m not Trump’s fan. He’s disruptive. He’s the world’s champion of bullshit.
- yes
- Just make a list of who the really good engineers are and weed out the rest,
- I have five hundred email submissions in my inbox,
- We’ve somehow got to go through them all tonight to see what engineers should stay.
- He believes that a small group of really great generalist engineers can outperform a regular group a hundred times larger,
- Like a small battalion of marines that is really tight can do amazing things. And I think he wants to rip the Band-Aid off. He doesn’t want to drag this out.
- no more layoffs.
- for cause
- There are no more RIFs planned,
- Hi, As a result of the recent code review exercise, it has been determined that your code is not satisfactory, and we regret to inform you that your employment with Twitter will be terminated effective immediately.
- psychological safety,
- Some days I wake up and look at Twitter to see if it’s still working.
- the company culture that built Twitter into one of the world’s most influential social networks.
- In some ways, Musk was vindicated,
- Twitter was less stable now, but the platform survived and mostly functioned even with the majority of employees gone. He had promised to right-size a bloated company, and now it operated on minimal head count.
- We were changing the engines while the plane was spiraling out of control,
- It’s a miracle we survived.
- Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter,
- Do they hate free speech in America?
- Tim doesn’t want any animosity,
- I thought, well, I don’t want any animosity either,
- So I’m like, cool, I will go visit him at the Apple headquarters.
- I was looking for an excuse to visit the Apple headquarters, because I heard it was incredible,
- I don’t think very many people could have done a better job than Tim has,
- That’s a future battle that we will have to fight,
- or at least a conversation that Tim and I will need to have.
- Thanks @tim_cook for taking me around Apple’s beautiful HQ,
- We resolved the misunderstanding about Twitter potentially being removed from the App Store. Tim was clear that Apple never considered doing so.
- Hatchet Alley
- Guys, this is a little hard to explain to people in a way that really grabs them,
- A paralyzed person might someday use their mind to move a cursor on a computer, and that’s kind of cool, especially for someone like a Stephen Hawking. But it’s not enough. It’s hard to get most people excited by that.
- Getting someone in a wheelchair to walk again, people will get it right away,
- It’s a gut-punch idea, a fucking bold thing. And a good thing.
- Elon felt that controlling a computer with your mind is nice, but it doesn’t have the same limbic resonance as making paralyzed people walk again,
- So we’ve been focused on a plan for that.
- We have to be able to distinguish between pain reactions and muscle actuation, otherwise it’s simply, ‘You can walk again but in agony,’ 
- But it does show we’re not breaking the laws of physics in trying to enable people to walk again, which would be just insanely mind blowing, Jesus-level stuff.
- The easiest would be fixing deafness through cochlear stimulation,
- Vision is super interesting. To get really high-fidelity vision, you need a lot of channels.
- We can give people crazy vision, you know?
- Want to see infrared? Ultraviolet? How about radio waves or radar? Yeah, that one’s cool for augmentation.
- I was rewatching Life of Brian,
- I was hopping along, minding my own business, all of a sudden, up he comes, cures me! One minute I’m a leper with a trade, next minute my livelihood’s gone. Not so much as a by-your-leave! ‘You’re cured, mate.’ Bloody do-gooder.
- If we don’t accelerate, we’re not going to achieve much in our lifetimes,
- My prime motivation with Neuralink,
- is to create a generalized input-output device that could interface with every aspect of your brain.
- Even if AI is benevolent, how do we make sure that we get to go along with the ride?
- The first is restoring vision,
- Even if someone was born blind, we believe we can allow them to see.
- As miraculous as it may sound, we’re confident that it is possible to restore full-body functionality to someone who has a severed spinal cord.
- dumpster fire
- You want me to whistle-blow on your own company?
- Go to town,
- This is not a North Korean guided tour. You can go wherever you want.
- There seems to be a lot of stuff swept under the rug,
- A lot of shady stuff.
- He seemed like someone who isn’t afraid of offending people,
- the Twitter Files,
- This is a battle for the future of civilization,
- If free speech is lost even in America, tyranny is all that lies ahead.
- #nothingburger.
- No, You Do Not Have a Constitutional Right to Post Hunter Biden’s Dick Pic on Twitter,
- A long list of government enforcement agencies essentially got to operate Twitter as an involuntary contractor,
- I just reviewed the accounts,
- None of them show any signs of affiliation to Russia.
- Russiagate
- You might like
- This is a perfect story for us to be doing,
- a reasonable liberal concerned that far-left critiques stifled free speech.
- Stay Woke
- The barbarians have crashed through the gates and are pillaging the merch!
- Really, I wasn’t sure I still wanted to do it, but the lawyers told me I had to chew down this hairball, so I am,
- the future of civilization,
- Birth rates are plummeting, the thought police are gaining power.
- We have a goal here, which is to clear the decks of any prior wrongdoing and move forward with a clean slate. I’m sleeping at Twitter HQ for a reason. This is a code-red situation.
- You almost believe him,
- Baker.
- My jaw dropped.
- What the fuck?
- You’re like asking the guy to do searches on himself? This makes no fucking sense.
- It’s like asking Al Capone to, like, look into his own taxes,
- Can you tell me what the main principles are in the consent decree?
- Because I have it in front of me. Can you name anything that’s in it?
- To be honest, I wanted to be as far away from what they were doing as possible,
- I was sort of trying to help, but I didn’t want to be too involved. I’m not a very political person, and it seemed like it had all kinds of crap written all over it.
- visibility filtering,
- shadow banning,
- Negative/hate tweets will be max deboosted & demonetized, so no ads or other revenue to Twitter,
- You won’t find the tweet unless you specifically seek it out.
- It operated a secret blacklist, with teams of employees tasked with suppressing the visibility of accounts or subjects deemed undesirable,
- The people in charge of these institutions enforced the new parameters by expanding the definitions of words like ‘violence,’ ‘harm,’ and ‘safety.’ 
- Hi. Can you come this weekend to Twitter headquarters so we can show you what Twitter 1.0 did?
- These companies seem not to have had much choice in being made key parts of a global surveillance and information control apparatus,
- although evidence suggests their Quislingian executives were mostly all thrilled to be absorbed.
- This is a difficult speech dilemma.
- Last night, car carrying lil X in LA was followed by crazy stalker (thinking it was me), who later blocked car from moving & climbed onto hood.
- My commitment to free speech extends even to not banning the account following my plane, even though that is a direct personal safety risk,
- visibility filtered
- Account suspended.
- He was doing the very things that he claimed to disdain about the previous overlords at Twitter,
- Some of the people he was kicking off were my biggest bullies on Twitter. I don’t like some of these people at all. But I felt like he was betraying the things he was claiming to want Twitter to be about—a public square that wasn’t rigged in favor of one side or the other. And just from a purely strategic perspective, he was martyring a lot of assholes.
- Hey, what’s going on here?
- They doxed my plane,
- They attacked my son.
- You can’t be a journalist and watch journalists get kicked off Twitter and say nothing,
- Principles still matter to me.
- I guess Elon won’t ever be our sperm donor now.
- The old regime at Twitter governed by its own whims and biases, and it sure looks like the new regime has the same problem,
- I oppose it in both cases.
- Rather than rigorously pursuing truth,
- you are virtue-signaling to show that you are ‘good’ in the eyes of media elite to keep one foot in both worlds.
- This is crazy,
- This is going to ruin attention to the Twitter Files. We’ve got to reverse it.
- You got to let these people come back.
- You’re suggesting that we’re sharing your address, which is not true,
- I never posted your address.
- You posted a link to the address,
- We posted links to elonjet, which is now not online,
- using the same exact link-blocking technique that you have criticized as part of the Hunter Biden New York Post story.
- We’re fixing a legacy bug,
- Should be working tomorrow.
- prosecute/Fauci.
- My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci.
- What the heck, man, this is an old guy who was just trying to figure things out during COVID,
- This is not okay.
- I think that Fauci made tremendous mistakes,
- But I think the right redress is not to prosecute him, but for history to remember him having made those mistakes.
- Fauci purchased omertà among virologists globally with a total of $37 billion in annual payoffs in research grants. With the paymaster gone, the orthodoxies will unravel.
- Precisely,
- This man should be fired!
- From all the info coming out, it appears the 9/11 attacks were a setup and the evidence is overwhelming,
- a lie.
- If you were stupid enough to have the injection, and especially ‘boosters,’ you are going to die soon.
- The Left (or gangsters) have got to be stopped,
- Civilization is at stake.
- essential
- He is our only ray of light.
- Trying to placate the gangsters is futile. The more you try, the less they fear or respect you. Hit them hard, or hit anyone hard, and they will respect you.
- I think I may have found the problem.
- That explains a lot,
- Gay Data,
- Looks like Yoel is arguing in favor of children being able to access adult Internet services.
- Musk made the decision to share a defamatory allegation that I support or condone pedophilia,
- I had to leave my home and sell it. Those are the consequences for this type of online harassment and speech.
- Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise for the richest man in the world,
- It sounds like some of those people you fired are in the audience,
- terrible seats.
- The giant elephant in the room was that he was acting like a fucking idiot,
- Does this timeframe seem like something that I would find remotely acceptable?
- Obviously not. If a timeline is long, it’s wrong.
- But this morning,
- they came back to us and said that plan was no longer on the table because, and these are their words, they don’t think that we will be financially viable.
- We can’t get out safely before six to nine months,
- Sacramento still needs to be around to serve traffic.
- You have ninety days to do it. If you can’t make that work, your resignation is accepted.
- It has different rack densities, different power densities,
- So the rooms need to be upgraded.
- This is making my brain hurt,
- I’m sorry, that was not my intention,
- Do you know the head-explosion emoji?
- That’s what my head feels like right now. What a pile of fucking bullshit. Jesus H fucking Christ. Portland obviously has tons of room. It’s trivial to move servers one place to another.
- Can you have someone go to our server centers and send me videos of the insides?
- No, tomorrow,
- I’ve built server centers myself, and I can tell if you could put more servers there or not. That’s why I asked if you had actually visited these facilities. If you’ve not been there, you’re just talking bullshit.
- All you need to do is just move the fucking servers to Portland,
- If it takes longer than thirty days, that would blow my mind.
- Just get a moving company, and it will take a week to move the computers and another week to plug them in. Two weeks. That’s what should happen.
- If you got a goddamn U-Haul, you could probably do it by yourself.
- Why don’t we do it right now?
- These things do not look that hard to move,
- You’ll have to hire a contractor to lift the floor panels,
- They need to be lifted with suction cups.
- Well that doesn’t seem super hard,
- The guys are kicking ass!
- I’ve never loaded a semi before,
- terrifying.
- but the stuff in it is totally critical.
- Bullshit,
- We have already loaded four onto the semi.
- The dude is not very good at math,
- It’s like the days of high school, when you kept getting beaten up.
- Why don’t you just not be CEO?
- You’re an idiot,
- Stop falling for weird shit.
- It’s not okay. It’s not funny. You can’t do that shit.
- This is not okay, guys. This is not okay.
- I really don’t give a shit about Twitter,
- It’s just a pimple on the ass of what should be your impact on the world.
- What regrets do you have?
- My main regret,
- is how often I stab myself in the thigh with a fork, how often I shoot my own feet and stab myself in the eye.
- stoics,
- He’s an outstanding programmer, so he could write software and do high school online, which is what Damian has done,
- I’m not pushing hard, because I know there’s a social element to school, but he’s way too smart for high school. It’s kind of ridiculous.
- He’s already at the graduate-school level in math and physics.
- I’m sorry this may sound a bit boastful, but I was number one in my class of four hundred fifty in computer science.
- Thank you,
- This means so much to me.
- Oh, yes,
- If anyone finds out I’m Elon Musk’s son, they are going to be mad at me because he’s ruining Twitter.
- She was the most insufferable person I’ve ever worked with,
- But to be fair, I could understand where she was coming from, because we were ruining her holidays, right?
- You get a dollar tip for every additional server we move,
- By the time we learned this, the servers had already been unplugged and rolled out, so there was no way we would roll them back, plug them in, and then wipe them,
- Fuck, what do we do?
- I can’t believe it worked,
- They all made it to Portland safely.
- My father loves woodworking, but he just sliced off part of his finger and is going through a rough time now,
- I’m very close to my dad.
- In retrospect, the whole Sacramento shutdown was a mistake,
- I was told we had redundancy across our data centers. What I wasn’t told was that we had seventy thousand hard-coded references to Sacramento. And there’s still shit that’s broken because of it.
- Look at this,
- This is where you are going to live someday.
- It was good for our nervous system to be together,
- We are a very complex family, and it’s really unusual for everyone to be happy at the same time.
- Got to get Starship into orbit,
- We’ve got to get Starship into orbit.
- It’s like ChatGPT, but for cars,
- We process an enormous amount of data on how real humans acted in a complex driving situation, and then we train a computer’s neural network to mimic that.
- learn-from-humans
- the neural network path planner.
- I’m going to be delayed by four hours,
- Do you mind waiting?
- I think it’s super important that I continue doing what I’m doing,
- Instead of determining the proper path of the car based only on rules,
- we determine the car’s proper path by also relying on a neural network that learns from millions of examples of what humans have done.
- Computing Machinery and Intelligence.
- It’s interesting to work on them together,
- They are both trying to navigate the world.
- No, because we only use data from humans when they handled a situation well,
- a five-star Uber driver would do,
- Here’s what happens when we move from rules-based to network-path-based,
- The car will never get into a collision if you turn this thing on, even in unstructured environments.
- We should do a James Bond–style demonstration,
- where there are bombs exploding on all sides and a UFO is falling from the sky while the car speeds through without hitting anything.
- I want the latest data on miles per intervention to be the starting slide at each of our meetings,
- If we’re training AI, what do we optimize? The answer is higher miles between interventions.
- Video games without a score are boring, so it will be motivating to watch each day as the miles per intervention increases.
- We were all holding our breath, because cyclists can be unpredictable,
- It felt exactly like what a human driver would do,
- It runs ten times faster and it could eventually allow for the deletion of 300,000 lines of code,
- Oh wow,
- even my human neural network failed here, but the car did the right thing.
- A Little Night Music
- Amazing work guys,
- This is really impressive.
- We are uniquely positioned to do this,
- OMG, the Industrial Revolution has just begun!
- specist
- I thought that would make them go away for two or three years,
- It was mind-blowing,
- It gave this very careful excellent answer that was perhaps better than any of us in the room might have given.
- summoned
- OpenAI was created as an open-source (which is why I named it ‘Open’ AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft,
- I’m still confused as to how a non-profit to which I donated $100M somehow became a $30B market cap for-profit. If this is legal, why doesn’t everyone do it?
- the most powerful tool that mankind has ever created,
- now in the hands of a ruthless corporate monopoly.
- He’s a jerk,
- He has a style that is not a style that I’d want to have for myself. But I think he does really care, and he is feeling very stressed about what the future’s going to look like for humanity.
- It was a side benefit, actually, that I realized only after the purchase,
- It’s a monetization opportunity,
- What can be done to make AI safe?
- I keep wrestling with that. What actions can we take to minimize AI danger and assure that human consciousness survives?
- There are a few important things I would like to talk to you about. Can only be done in person.
- The Ides of March in Austin.
- singularity
- That could happen sooner than we expected,
- They’re sitting around seriously discussing plans to build a city on Mars and what people will wear there, and everyone’s just acting like this is a totally normal conversation.
- batch processing,
- I can’t just sit around and do nothing,
- With AI coming, I’m sort of wondering whether it’s worth spending that much time thinking about Twitter. Sure, I could probably make it the biggest financial institution in the world. But I have only so many brain cycles and hours in the day. I mean, it’s not like I need to be richer or something.
- So what should my time be spent on?
- Getting Starship launched. Getting to Mars is now far more pressing.
- Also, I need to focus on making AI safe. That’s why I’m starting an AI company.
- It will be easier to get them if they can become founders of a new company and get equity in it,
- Tesla’s real-world AI is underrated,
- Imagine if Tesla and OpenAI had to swap tasks. They would have to make Self-Driving, and we would have to make large language-model chatbots. Who wins? We do.
- reason
- think
- truth
- Build a better rocket engine.
- a maximum truth-seeking AI. It would care about understanding the universe, and that would probably lead it to want to preserve humanity, because we are an interesting part of the universe.
- Answer to The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.
- My stomach is twisted in knots,
- It always happens before a big launch. I have PTSD from the failures on Kwaj.
- My biggest concern is our trajectory. Are we on a trajectory to get to Mars before civilization crumbles?
- It’s worth keeping in mind as you go through all the tribulations that the thing you’re working on is the coolest fucking thing on Earth. By a lot. What’s the second coolest? This is far cooler than whatever is the second coolest.
- Getting the license was existentially soul-sucking,
- My fucking brain is hurting,
- I’m trying to figure out how we get humanity to Mars with all this bullshit.
- This is how civilizations decline. They quit taking risks. And when they quit taking risks, their arteries harden. Every year there are more referees and fewer doers.
- When you’ve had success for too long, you lose the desire to take risks.
- An awesome day
- fated.
- The most entertaining outcome is the most likely.
- Occupy Mars!
- I don’t think that would be an actual risk.
- Perfect!,
- Ode to Joy.
- Holy shit, it’s going up!
- destruct signal
- rapid unscheduled disassembly
- This could turn out to be a mistake,
- We don’t want to design to eliminate every risk,
- Otherwise, we will never get anywhere.
- Nicely done guys,
- Success. Our goal was to get clear of the pad and explode out of sight, and we did. There’s too much that can go wrong to get to orbit the first time. This is an awesome day.
- Elon is not one for looking back and being sentimental,
- He’s not good at that type of empathy.
- One day when I was young, my parents warned me against playing with fire,
- So I took a box of matches behind a tree and started lighting them.
- Molded out of faults
- We had a similar vision of what Twitter could become, and I wanted to help him, which led to me stalking him to let me interview him in Miami,
- I would still have to work at Twitter,
- You build the product, you pass the baton to me, and I execute and sell it.
- We want to bring the public in on everything we’re doing,
- Then they will support us. That’s why we live-streamed the Starship launch, even knowing it was likely to explode at some point.
- molded out of faults.
- I’ve shot myself in the foot so often I ought to buy some Kevlar boots,
